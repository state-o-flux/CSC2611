    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>This file contains documentation for CSLU: Kids' Speech Version 1.1 , Linguistic 
  Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2007S18 and isbn 1-58563-395-X. </p>
<p>CSLU Kids' Speech Version 1.1 is a collection of spontaneous and prompted speech 
  from 1100 children between Kindergarten and Grade 10 in the Forest Grove School 
  District in Oregon. All children -- approximately 100 children at each grade 
  level -- read approximately 60 items from a total list of 319 phonetically-balanced 
  but simple words, sentences or digit strings. Each utterance of spontaneous 
  speech begins with a recitation of the alphabet and contains a monologue of 
  about one minute in duration. This release consists of 1017 files containing 
  approximately 8-10 minutes of speech per speaker. Corresponding word-level transcriptions 
  are also included. </p>
<p>This corpus was developed to facilitate research about the characteristics 
  of children's speech at different ages and to train and evaluate recognizers 
  for use in language training and other interactive tasks involving children, 
  including to train recognizers used in language development with deaf children.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>

<p> Data collection was performed using the <a href="http://www.cslu.ogi.edu/toolkit/">CSLU 
  Speech Toolkit</a> and two computers running Windows NT 4.0. Each computer was 
  manned by a CSLU staff member who monitored progress and helped the child with 
  any difficulties. The average time at the computer was 20 minutes, yielding 
  approximately 8-10 minutes of speech digitized at 16 bits and 16kHz using Soundblaster 
  16 PnP audio cards with head-mounted microphones. </p>

<p> The prompted speech, consisting of 200 isolated words and 10 numeriuc strings, 
  was presented as text appearing below an animated character that produced accurate 
  visible speech synchronized with recored prompts. A text prompt was also displayed. 
  The child then reproduced the prompted word. Once the prompted speech collection 
  was completed, the experimenter then asked the subject a series of questions 
  designed to elicit spontaneous speech (i.e "Tell me about your favorite movie"). 
  Information about the subject's age, gender, languages spoken and physical conditions 
  affecting speech were also collected. </p>
