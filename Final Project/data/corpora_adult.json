{"corpus": "so you do   not need to go borrow equipment from anybody to to do the foot do the hoof well we   be gon na have to find somewhere to get something so mae i   be gon na mae lynne we   be not gon na do the foot today i   be gon na wait till like early in the morning to do those cause y i mean you get so tired n you just it take well it take me longer than most people cause you know i   be not as strong and and i   be not as good as like somebody that would do it all the time you know i mean oh i mean i trim horse and stuff like that but i mean i   be not like i   be not uh i do   not know how to say it but you know they do it for a living you know most people that you would get to trim your horse do it all the time and i   be not that good or and i   be not very strong do they train you yeah do they train you that yeah yeah so you have your own equipment but no i do   not have my own equipment at all dad you know have do some of it that   be another thing too be i kinda have a b general idea of kinda how to do it just watch him or and watch people come to our place and do it and stuff you know and i do   not know then down there um it   be mandatory you have to to graduate you know or well to get the degree you know you have to take this class and you can only take if you want to you can only take it for eight week and if you wan na go on in it you n then you can go on you know and i decide to go ahead and go on in it and the first part of it be like well we have lecture then we have lab and like the first part of it we just go into the classroom and he like in the beginning of the year there be a lot of classroom work i mean it that   be just kinda how it happen you know because he kinda have to tell you they go over the whole the whole part of the horse i mean all the skeleton part of it you know and and they go through every kinda ligament and i mean there   be million of ligament and million of tendon you know well not million but i mean yeah i bet and then so we have to know these tendon and ligament and then all the bone and you know all the way up from the shoulder down and then from the hip down you know all the way down to the hoof and then the bone in the hoof and then all the wall and you know of the hoof and what everything be call there and then he go over on how to trim it and where you th there   be a white line that you go by and a horse have this little white line and you clean it out with the with the hoof knife you know and then there and then you can see this little white line and that   be kinda where you go by to you know the horse kinda help you out because it have that little white line right there mhm and that   be where you kinda kinda need a little guide of where you trim and i be still scared to do it because you know i mean you can make a horse go lame by do it really well you can trim em too short and make em you know and they   be just a little bit for f the first couple of day you know i mean they   be just sore that   be not bad but sometimes you can get it really bad you can really make a horse really bad and they m you know then they have to like keep em away from anything you know get em really in the soft ground and no hard pebble or hard clod of dirt or anything so i do   not know i   be a little scared about do it yet you know i get em really long i mean they   be still long when i get do with them a lot of time like i   will get do and i   will think i   be do and i   will look at look down at the horse   be hoof and it   be still it   be too long and then like i would never ever ever trust myself to shoe a horse see we do that too we do we do a lot of stuff we do a lot of stuff with the like we have the um the burner you know and you   would put the you   would have you start out with the straight iron you know and you   would stick it into the into the you know like actual blacksmithing and you   would put it into the hot coal you know and then we   would i i straight bar and we   would make it a a horseshoe out of it you know but these shoe we never do put on a horse we just put the shoe that be already make on a horse and that   be as far as we get i mean if you would really get into it well as a matter of fact this be really funny you know there be   not really any girl farrier around anywhere they   be really farri th yeah farrier be what they   be call and the m the reason they be show us this at college be just to get us to know if our trimmer and shoer were do it right and plus the knowledge of know the bone and ligament which we we have it in another class too we that be kind of a double thing that we have in in another class so it be kinda review for us well it be a review for some people depend on what time of the year you take it you know if it be a review or not but anyway um what be i gon na say i forgot what i be think you say you never make the horseshoe gon na say p but well w um when we put em on a horse   be hoof all we do they   be already make they   be round we pick out a size you know we   would like look at the horse   be hoof and say okay this be a double aught this be an aught this be you know what s what size and double aught and aught be the one that be most popular for you know the light horse you know i mean you get into the big horse the like the clydesdale shire that   be a d a whole different thing or pony that   be a whole different thing but we   be talk just the regular light horse you know and aught and aught uh aught and double aught be the two size well anyway you go get your okay this be after you trim em and you go get your shoe it   be already make it   be already round you pick out your size you go look and every horse   be hoof be shape different it do   not matter every horse be gon na have a little different shape and so what you have to do so every every uh horseshoe be make custom make for the horse then no no no what what we do then that   be that   be where the ferrier come in every shoe be like you get order you know i would like a b case of double aught shoe you   would get the ferri get em you know that   be the way it go and then our job be to shape the shoe to the horse   be foot and that it d it sound easy but it   be really hard to do i mean some of em you have to you know like say okay say your shoe   be like this and your horse   be foot be just really wide or something well then you have to put it on the anvil and get the shoe stretch out well then once you stretch the shoe out well then the two corner they go out too you know okay your shoe   be like this you stretch this out well then it   be gon na make these go way out too and they get like this right then you have to round these back you know it   be just it s it sound easy but it   be really hard to do and then i would never do it cause i   would never trust myself to do it i mean we have to do it but it   be just that people would volunteer their horse to the college because it cost like thirty buck to get your horse shod i mean that   be just how much it cost could you imagine all those horse out there if we have em all shod that   be how many have you get thirty buck for twenty horse twenty twenty eight horse you know i mean jesus that would be a th nine hundred dollar just like that i mean could you imagine so w you know like a lot of people that have a lot of horse and stuff and that they   be ride a lot they   will just let the college kid do em for em you know they   be take the risk of have their horse get lame but it really never happen cause we have our s instructor right there tell us this be what you do and it   be not like there   be a person that   be just gung ho and go and just trim their foot and put the shoe on you know you d you d you ca   not do that and so we have our instructor right there and we ask a million question all the time i mean he e he just run around everywhere you know so it   be but uh p what be i gon na say p oh and it   be really tiring though and it you know like you get so i   have only do like well at the end of the year now see i take the second half of the course and right now i   have probably only shoe about five horse trim a lot of em and you know what we start out with this be the grossest of everything what we start out with dead horse hoof i mean you know the the cannery you know and stuff you know the people that that kill the horse for meat and stuff you know they have all these leg and stuff and i do   not know everybody i think they use the the horsehoove in for gelatin that   be not so you know i think they do i think a lot of time but then they they probably use em for everything i do   not know what all they use em for but anyway we get these horse hoof from this one cannery they they have to go a long way to go get em like back east somewhere to get these horse hoof for the college they go back east and they get em and they freeze em you know so we have this frozen horse hoof that we have to start out on cause you do   not want to cripple up a really good horse and like my first hoof that horse would have be lame like crazy but it be just and oh god it   be so gross because sometimes if you get one that   be be thaw out a little bit they start really stink and stuff oh it   be the gross thing oh it   be just so icky i mean you have this piece of horse i mean this leg that   be oh it   be just gross and like in some of em blood will spurt out you know and i mean oh it   be nothing it   be the gross thing and that   be why that   be probably why they have to make that class mandatory because at the beginning of the year it   be just the it   be the pit but once you get into it it   be the funn thing and you know it   be really interesting to do stuff like that but i would have never get into that class if there   be no way if i do   not have to have it there   be no way i mean i hear everybody say um you know like the people that take the class before talk about oh you have to do this you have to do that there   be dead horse hoof you know you got ta and they stink and all this other stuff and i be just go oh my god i   be never i do   not want to take that class so maybe i   will wait till next year q and then i think no i   will get it out of the way now and then once i get into it geez i wan na take the second half of it it be just really interesting to me you know but at first it be kind of a bummer but i   be glad i take it really glad it pay off especially you know twelve buck for a trim i mean that   be twelve buck every time i can go out and trim my own horse   be hoof right you know and i would   not trust myself to do it with a horse that i be really use a lot or anything but the one that be stand around that   be still twelve dollar you know i mean whether the horse be use a lot or not that   be twelve buck and shoot i can do those you know but i always have anybody i always have somebody that really know what they   be do for the horse that i   be really really use but anyway i wan na wait until the morning to do that because it   be just too hot in the afternoon to try to sit out there i mean you can get just exhaust anyway i be gon na tell you about that the girl you know there be   not mary very many ferri girl you know and her heart that do this this summer i meet one jorgensen   be they have one shoer that come to their house all the time they   have have him for year and year and year and i guess like in minnesota it   be real wet and stuff you know so like they really have to watch their shoe for not come off because the hoof wall be so much soft it   be like when you   be down there your hand be soft and everything you know and they   be not as dry or anything when you get back here we have dry hoof we have to watch out for like uh like the hoof be too dry we have to put ointment on em and stuff the back there they   be too wet not this time of the year because you know they   have have a dry year but usually they   be too wet and that that shoe can just pull right off because it   be just the hoof wall be so soft yeah it seem weird that that   be like that you know and i nei i never know that until i take this class either i do   not realize that in you know if you think about it yeah if it rain a lot the horse be always wet and it   be always moist and it   be always on something moist yeah sure it   be gon na be soft but i never even think about that until i take this class so it   be you know that   be kinda stuff too that you think about but anyway they always have this one horseshoer and this girl   be be in this ferri uh she   be go to an actual ferri college they have a lot of those around a lot and she   be go to one of em and she   be be go for like nine month to this one and she   be still get a lot more where be the uh leave to go what where be the oh right here guess i   will put it on it   be not on but anyway she have um she he   be like take her as a you know help her out and stuff you know for the summer she   be be work with him all summer and it   be really different to see a girl do it you know you just do   not see that airconditionerfanbegin at all ever jorgensen   be have a girl or a g you know a guy they   have have a guy be a horseshoer for a long time you know and they be um there   be this girl that   be work with him for the summer unhunh and she   be gon na be a ferri yeah i could   not believe it and she   be just little she   be a tiny girl but boy i tell you she   be get arm the size of they   be huge but she must only what be m blow out of there well that   be what happen with that air conditioner it   be just it get dust accumulate in it see it   be all over the tv it be just on last night how do it get dust in it already well i it mae lynne for one thing the filter be dirty because it it so be so dry and the it all come acrost the road you know and and then it build up real bad with cough deposit out of the water oh in other word i should be change filter ugh god i know it wo   not last long but it sure do make a mess in the house yeah it make a mess i need new filter anyway this girl must only weigh like a hundred and ten pound i mean she   be just a little shit and she   be out there and she   be get huge arm i mean she   be in shape like you ca   not believe she   be out there just work away and those guy be so used to it that they do it all day long you know mhm and that do   not bother em a bit to just go out there and trim and trim and trim and shoe and everything but for me that   be something i   be not use to and boy i tell you you just sweat just roll off of you i just it   be tire the very at the very beginning when we first start do it we only do like one hoof then we move up to two then we move up to a full horse you know and we be just slowly get in shape do that you know but now if i go to do that holy smokes i   would never be able to handle it why it   be just it   be a it   be hard work it be really hard work you   be bent over and it   be you know it take like i do   not know why you sweat so bad do it either but you just oh it   be just it   be just hard hard work it   be it do   not seem like it would be but it be it   be really take a lot of muscle to do it too i mean a lot those it   be hard you do   not get kick a lot i   have never be kick ever but like it those college h be course you know like i be talk our horse be a little well than most people   be horse cause they   have be around people a lot and they they do   not get by with stuff i mean we do get mad at our horse for you know whatever they do wrong we do get mad at em like i notice horse at college they just have   not be discipline enough and they   be just it   be like a kid they   be just be ornery you know and like they   will move around and kinda be ornery about half way but not not too bad i   have never be kick do it at all and that   be another thing we have to learn in the class you know just have to learn our safety of where to stand and how to stand you have to stand like these certain way and oh and it   be a killer on your back cause you   be stand like this oh i   be sorry berry you   be stand whoop you   be stand like this you know and like when you   be in the back the horse   be hoof lay like this right over you and you   be like this working you know this be like a hoof knife then a you know so you   be always bent over you   be always bent over and like in the front you stick the horse   be hoof between your leg you know kinda like that and you kinda you go like this you kinda bend down like this and you have the horse   be hoof right here it   be hard on your back it   be really hard on your back like i notice that girl   be back muscle be just tremendous too you know could   not believe it she have like on this really p kinda short shirt you know there   be this i think that   be cold just do   not it   be if you rub something against it it   be just make a sound nkay so what what be you gon na do out there today what other what other thing be you gon na just go out and um look at the filly yeah i think more or less it   be get about so late now pretty much all we   be gon na do be go out i do   not know what her plan really be but i think pretty much just go out and take care of em and then maybe go to that seasonal dance or whatever it be be that what it   be call i do   not know i do   not know what it   be call either you know he say there be four guy do that do what the dance you know how he say there   be four guy i wonder if that mean like since there   be four season you know i wonder if that have something to do with it unhunh since he call it a seasonal dance he   be a pretty neat guy i think yeah he speak crow okay i get a kick out of him when he keep say it see this little cat little cat i do   not wan na see the little cat i know i know that sound like kitten that sound like kit i do   not wan na say kitten that sound stupid so she name everybody in the class except for about four people well i think they ask for name oh do they hunh that   be funny look at how much that air conditioner blow on that blue bag right there yeah i notice on the on the case for the tape recorder too that it   be all that it   be all cover today look right here look at your cigarette even look right here just geez just from sit here for just a minute that   be look at the cigarette it   be like ash be it from that must be from the fire or what you know maybe it be maybe it be uh cause that one whole day you could   not even see or anything from but look at your cigarette just sit there oh yeah on the way into r from roundup yesterday morning the radio be on and they be talk about the weather and they say how we everybody wake up with ash all over their car today and in roundup on the way from roundup i be listen to the radio yesterday morning and they be talk and so this be probably like a billing radio station or something like that yeah unhunh be that right and they say well everybody wake up with ashe on their car today and i guess just from the fire yeah it be i be tell mae lynne hunh uh day before yesterday it be the most weird day i   have ever see in my entire adult life it be um the wind be blow real hot when i first get up and it be early real early like seven o'clock in the morning that that wind be just hot and next thing you know it be just overcast well the smoke all blow in just like there be a fire right around close and it be just dense you could   not even hardly see very far away okay then it that s it just kinda blow the smoke in and then blow it out but then it be real hazy and there be just dust particle all over and it be you   would look at the sun and it would just look red i mean you could   not see the sun it be just she say people be drive around with their light on yeah and the light be they do   not look like they be it   be just from the drought and the dust you know and the smoke in the air i   have never see anything like it and she say like the light look a greenish color yeah they look a green you know how they look yellow at night you know yeah they just look green it be a weird ugly ugly day rana lee   be gon na have a baby by the way who be rana lee p brian   be wife brian   be wife i do   not even know she be pregnant three month ago of course i guess they can get big in three month well i i tell you too what   be her name bran f what   be her name rana lee rana lee f unhunh rana lee hm i do   not know why i tell you that sing rana lee sing she have a brother that die from asthma too seem like a lot of people i mean that   be weird that i would know two people that die from asthma you know why do   not we go just in except just in a matter of a year   be time this washing be really yeah her brother be like just right out of high school i mean you know do mom tell you about deb at all she probably really could   not since genetta be there you know she be like she be in the hospital in and out of the hospital all the time and stuff ever since she be little she be in and out of the hospital who be that debby debby i mean she be in she love horse so much stuff on it and she be always like she   be allergic to horsehair horse sweat oh you know stuff like that but she would   not quit ride em so well she   be allergic to everything it do   not matter be say it do   not matter what she do do she ever go to a allergy doctor or anybody like that oh yeah she t well they she never do take shot do she no i do   not know why they should   have they should have get her i do   not know why they do   not either i i w always wonder about that and she be s she have such severe asthma that i would have do a little bit more for her i think if you wan na talk about somebody tired that girl that girl could   not walk down to the street and back without take a nap and me and mom always accuse her of be lazy you know because she be just all she do be sleep she sound like she have more problem than and now that when we think about it she probably be   not really lazy she   be probably just exhausted i mean you know if you think about it we like take everything for grant we take our air for grant you know then somebody like that every little breath be like and effort to em d and you know and if i have to go through an effort just in breathe all the time well debby get i would be tired too debby get to the point where all she would do be when she do you know every just really often she would go to try to get enough air in and her they have an autopsy do on her and her heart be just hard on one side from labor breathe all of her life it have just labor her heart so bad she actually die of a heart attack she do yeah they do have an autopsy do on her yes it surprise me but they they do and it be actually a and her heart be hard cardiac arrest mhm one side of her heart be just hard from the muscle the muscle be just hard from just labor breathe geez try to breathe all the time that   be just sick yeah we think she be just lazy and kind of worthless but we do   not realize what she be go through and you know maybe that   be another reason why she do   not really maybe mom she kinda know about all this stuff and maybe that   be why she do   not really pay that much attention to amanda i mean not because i mean it seem like she   would pay more attention to her but maybe it   be because she want to have a little fun in her life too and know it be   not gon na last forever for her you know i mean i guess like right before she die and stuff she   be like tell her mom like well if i go i want this here and i want that there and you know just little thing be amanda her kid or yeah oh she have a little three year old daughter it   be just too bad i just hope orville and genetta get that little girl oh they wo   not there   be no be they even try they ca   not they want her three month out of the year but they have no legal ground i mean you know he be the legal father and there   be not much they can do oh she be divorce mhm yeah and he be such a weirdo this be the type of person that be like a hermit i do   not know what you   would call him well they be rai raise backward he   be like uh back wood back woodsy raise in the mountain do   not d never come down out of the mountain he do   not have any he do   not know what   be go on in this world no he do   not he be just not properly bring up he i mean he would   not even have the slight idea where be he from um i forget idaho idaho and up in the mountain in idaho um macley and arco be   not that where deb kinda be but he   be just really really really strange how can you teach a three year old to tap dance i ca   not imagine teach a yeah really who suggest this to em i have no idea it be probably my sister in law   be idea because i think they see that movie tap what be the they have the movie with that really hot tap dancer oh that kid he be actually here two week ago and i miss him at the at the jazz tap thing or whatever be he a little kid no he   be sixteen now no he   be like yeah he   be a teenager but he teach these class in new york that boy he   be suppose to be awesome yeah really fast hm but i   be sure that be the the impetus have you see him no i just read an article on him you you probably read the same examiner article i read yeah probably yeah talk about how gregory hines say he do   not realize a human being ca   not tap that fast right right yeah and they be talk about how he   be teach these class hm and i guess he really go fast and yeah he k he do   not explain anything precisely he have to double it down to like one fifth speed or something before they can g pick it up well i   be sure thomas be all over it probably i mean he have a bro could have see him i guess that mean his broken leg be do okay i be wonder about that i be imagine he have break an arm or something oh yeah but it be his leg yeah that   be like i guess that he be be haul around in a little wagon and stuff right he heal very quickly guess kid ' bone just like grow back really fast mhm yeah i think they   be really soft to start with they   be make of rubber th that   be it that   be why b little kid usually do   not break their leg anyway cause they   be so cause they   be make of rubber but they have more cartilage than w you know yeah be   not they real s be   not their k leg pretty soft yeah there   be less calcium deposit in them and also mm they   be still grow and the way bone grow be you make cartilage and then you deposit calcium in it oh and then that turn into hard bone so that   be why they always have more flexibility cause as they   be grow hm you   be make cartilage so it al mhm they always have that until they reach adulthood in which case they get old and cranky like the rest of us it stop unhunh and then they break old and rickety and brittle mhm mhm uncoordinated and unflexible right stiff inflexible that too what be you plan on do with dancing harold you be take some class last fall i   will take a few more as a you will it turn out as a spouse i get in free oh really so that   be not bad to group class yeah hm so i should do that oh really mhm that   be why you marry her some benefit mm hunh mhm better than nothing oh i can not believe you say that what a jerk you be be   not you guy gon na stick up for me and beat up on him or something he   be big than i be he   be not big than you no but he   be my he

yeah the other in addition to a mustache and a beard but the thing be that second one look like the guy who be in one of the oba oba skit do you know those any of those dance all of em all of em the little what look like the second why one from the top look like a guy who be in the oba oba k skit what   be an oba oba skit oba oba oh the brazilian troop that be here dance yeah oh yeah i never see that look like a real an actual person do it or some kind of mask they have or no uh the guy look like that or there   be a guy look like that yeah that   be pretty good just like him with the right i mean that look kinda like a black person with red eye and everything so where be this from this be   not from africa be it no from indonesia but that person look black which one be it or do indonesian people look black look pink to me the which one the i figure the second one from the top tumenggung the second from the top tumenggung hunh i look at that and think yeah that look like a brother that   be interesting cause i think indo indonesians think or people who   have be to indonesia think that those guy like the two top one have really european characteristic compare to indonesians uh just cause their eye be real big and their nose be big their eye be round oh really and indonesians have real thin eye and and flat nose and stuff i do   not know p except those well i do   not know the the bottom one do   not have flat nose either that   be true they all have b they all have big nose but they get big as you go up anyway what do you think make em look african their mustache be it the the way their little beard go oh no that   be not even relevant i d i just glance at that hunh and i immediately see this guy   be face in oba oba yeah hunh that   be interesting p he look like that guy poor guy that be really interesting yeah bulge eye cause i remember he come to bahia after one of his show one night   be kinda funny wow well the top guy have a real thick lip oh in his black leather jacket and his black mm klana have a real thick lip hood hat right pretty bad overbite too he   be in oba oba you know smoke he do   not yeah then he try to he dance with a friend of mine yeah what happen but she do   not wan na dance with him anymore i say boy he just want to get close to me oo oo mm i say well ca   not blame him oba oba myeah gross mm but i   be sure those guy get a lot of attention from woman they travel all over the world i   be sure a lot of woman throw themselves at em so that   be what they expect from woman a lot of groupie yeah fringe benefit hm the only fringe benefit of be a dancer probably well in san francisco but then again you never know if it   be a benefit or not either that   be true i do   not know this but apparently in brazil they have a very very high aids infection rate really oh oh probably it   be suppose to be very high mm you mean like very unmonitored high than the united state too high than around here that   be what i   have hear hm i would   not be surprised p have you hear these figure that like um it   be something like forty percent of male in the bay area be suppose to be infect well last july oh really this be what of homosexual male or of male of all male of male in general this infectious disease woman or male under thirty i think it be at san francisco general mhm she say that this do   not seem like it can be true but she say that ninety per cent of gay man be hiv positive and fifty percent of all male be hiv positive yeah that   be what she say fifty perc it be some like a m half or more than half of and it be fairly young man but be have be expose to hiv virus it be   not necessarily that they be infect well if you   be hiv positive it   be the same difference mhm since they feel that sooner or later you   will come down with the actual disease mhm yeah but that   be what she say now i do   not know if she mean the bay area or san francisco but those be some ferocious number if one out of yeah that   be just horrible two guy you meet yeah cause there   be a lot of woman out there who apparently do   not believe in use condom hm i   be just amazed dumb move see i   would heard that it be mainly really dumb in t   be mainly urban area yeah that have this really disproportionately high propor um percentage and then like r rural area or like you know central iowa and stuff have like ten percent or less of the male have be infect well i would assume san francisco be high than most city around the country unhunh mhm but that just blow me away cause i   be think well gee if half of all the man be hiv positive what do that mean about the woman they   be have sex with right yeah well but and just talk with guy in their twenty wh why wh i mean these guy say these woman do   not care if they use rubber or not this be what guy have be tell me you know and i   be think i i ca   not believe that cause in this city with all the information available it seem like right yeah stupid people people have the information they need it be just amazing that people in their twenty apparently be   not right that   be really scary so i guess it   be time for me to become a priest it   be too dangerous out there oh i do   not know i could   not believe it this woman i know i be gon na ask out br god br you have to be catholic first her sister who   be an hiv counselor be tell me how her sister just wo   not use rubber at all hm well where would she put them and i   be think i   be think well how can you not my sister do   not i mean what be they think i do   not know p do   not look at me i i be just really amazed to hear that people in their twenty we   be innocent cause i figure we do   not have sex grow up around here you would know well and in high school you know they teach about it mhm so i do   not know not only that but they have really lewd billboard all over the castro district something   be wrong i know i think we get our electricity fix that   be kind of scary i think i turn this off though it   be be do do   not i oh that   be right but you do that   be really scary then this be salsa right yeah what what who be this i do   not know it   be from the radio station year ago when i be in santa cruz you know on sunday at ten o'clock that   be right now kay what be that kay oh i do   not know what the radio station be they play salsa it begin with a kay though no they play this they have a brazilian jazz hour be there a kksf i do   not know what it be but it be like i go to bahia what   be last sunday get there at eight leave a ten drop this person off at home in foster city and come back and i be notice the song they be play on the radio be the exact same song they be singe at bahia the b live band there hm should i turn on the radio statio you do   not know what station it be on i i be kksf do that mean anything to you p nope you have to translate it to a number i be in a rental car so it be just whatever station it be on mm hm but uh i be just remember be surprised cause i do   not realize i do   not know anything about brazilian music you go to the brazilian club and they   be singe song apparently i guess that   be the popular stuff i guess i   be so used to hear those song cause i   have hear em for the past three month i do   not think anything of it but then this guy play song for a whole hour and it be like eighty per cent of those song i   would that band have sing that very night mhm pickup band   be pretty good there viva well they have a different band every night who be it viva brazil oh i go on the friday night so maybe it be different band um when do you do that oh a while ago the dance floor   be too small in that place though it   be really annoying p i like this song p be they teach any more lambada at uh school yeah vivian be give a lambada lesson cause uh when i be there the other day well my lambada   be definitely get well really really i wan na go out lambada dance with you i mean i   be gon na start dance with those brazilian woman so i can learn how to beat my hip i mean cause their their hip be beat up against you you know like that fast hundred cycle per second or something i mean i be not kid it it be a different sensation entirely when you   be dance with them i bet and the only way to learn how be to dance with them more that   be true but i feel like i can start dance with them now but uh no th i do   not i do   not they have   not do anything recently i i ca   not remember if they   be go to cause like sue swing teach that class for two month may and june and uh be she a good lambada dancer i ca   not imagine her be a yeah but i do   not feel like she teach it any different significantly differently than when vivian and jeff teach it i mean cause they do it real basic and real simple different than brazilian do it yeah i mean i do   not know what those brazilian woman be do what be they do but their hip be like be they go be they go like really fast i mean be they go one two three i mean one two three first you have this wide sway of their hip this way and then it   be like they   be come i mean they   be beat me like this i do   not even know how you can do that you   be dance with them they   be beat you just like this use their hand like that no use their pelvic bone wow mm right here yeah sort of like tahitian dancer or something yeah you know close but i tell you but anyway you know they be   not teach it that way you know the ballroom people do   not do it that way but that   be what i want to learn do   not do   not they teach do   not they teach you to go one two three one two three one two three like that or do they go like really fast like that well sue swing i mean when she be teach be definitely more sedate and the same thing with jeff and vivian viv yeah it be just jeff and sure but that   be cause it   be for s it   be for people who ca   not move their hip right i mean it   be for basic you know this be a begin lambada class or intermediate i do   not know why they do it that way i mean it seem to me if they   be gon na teach it like what you do or what they teach and what happen socially could be two different thing you know i mean brazilian definitely do   not hm do it like that i should i want to go i should check it out i like that cause it   be fun p i mean after i f i mean i be you do they still teach at bahia on sunday night oh yeah in fact i would have go today if it be   not for my back well i finally find some people there i can dance with so that help do you need a partner to go there yeah no besides you i mean if you   be a guy if if you   be a woman i mean those guy   will be all over you i swear it do   not say that run along now harold   be in the room dear you could come too well i do   not necessarily mean in a bad way even though i   be sure there be a few there i   be not dance with guy all i can say be the woman be   not all over me darn oo but but i remember like i go there with this person it   be kind of funny th this person do not want to dance so she   be just gon na watch so every once in a while i   would get up and dance and it   be like when i   would come back i mean there be some guy there sit in my chair every time i get up i   be think god these guy do   not waste any time i mean you turn your back and there   be somebody move in i mean i do   not know if they maybe harold you should come with me why so i can find learn some lam lambada find some girl with empty chair next to em maybe i should go with mile oh do yeah you guy could be partner do what well i do   not know if i tell you tell you that story about that woman who uh go after that guy there i tell you that story right i be there sunday three four week ago uh after the class be over w over with i   be sit down at a table there   be a woman from who be in the class and two man sit to my right be a table with two woman there they have apparently just come from oba oba on the last night oh i think you tell me the last night yeah p and like well they be attractive woman the one have on a real real short skirt anyway there be this guy in his fifty out there dance br by himself br and the woman be just look at him make eye then she go out there get on her knee in front of him in this skirt that   be this short take her hand and go along his toe and then up and be just do like that i figure oo oh they must know each other oo very well in fact mhm gross that   be what i assume and they do that for the whole dance and i mean she be d all kind of suggestive stuff and touch him and everything people would like cheer clap and clap go for it q and all this kind of thing the the song end the guy set down at another table and she set down at a at the table with her woman friend they never dance again the rest of the evening hm this be like so i be think this woman   be sit about as far away from me as jamie be and i be think hm this be interesting i wonder how long it be gon na take the guy in this club to move in on her no sooner do i think this thought guy be over there what you do   not ask her to dance not mile he   be just in daze well i be still try to figure out surely they must know each other i mean why be   not he sit at her table you mean you werestill think about it anyway this guy i mean he come over there immediately afterwards the same guy who get his the same guy who   be no it   be just some random guy or just some random guy no a random guy who be like sit about where you be yeah he be sit there there be two guy sit at a table right where you be and then these two woman be sit here so uh he come over there and be talk with that woman i do   not know about what but then like ten minute later she and her friend be over at their table and then twenty minute later they be kinda like all over each other you know kiss et cetera et cetera and i be think it look like these people be   not go home alone tonight gosh but i just think that no wonder they forbid this dance so oh my god what a story well maybe i should   not go there then yeah maybe you should   not it it it be interesting no i go there before it be fine it be really fun you be there before yeah i go out there before oh without even tell harold without tell me you know if i be go out dance oh oh i do remember a few month ago i use to go out dance every now and then hm m i do   not remember well the thing that get me i meet this to caesar   be and stuff i meet this psychotherapist who tell me she   be addict to this dance which i th think be a interesting choice of word for a psychotherapist to use but uh she   be married and apparently she   be there without her husband she have her wedding ring on and it   be like she   be with this guy and they   be kinda like all over each other and i   be think well i guess that   be her husband uh oh do you say something but i but i be think but the thing be you know she   be kind of all sophisticated and everything and i   be think you know this guy i ca   not really believe that guy   be her husband so i do   not know what   be go on here and of course later on i find out that   be not her husband so i   be think you know i do   not know what   be go on here but uh bizarre gossip but then she tell me gee i do   not know what it be about this guy i mean i   have be try to tell him i do   not want a sexual relationship with him and i   be think from the way they look when i   would see them three week before it look to me like they have one i   be think you do   not do that with so this be all at bahia stranger all this stuff happen at bahia yeah hunh to other people i mean h well i mean maybe that be actually very profound yeah that be maybe you can just go up to a woman and you know do that kinda thing yeah you you wind up get punch mhm be what   will happen probably something   will land in your mouth well it sound like there you would   not be though what

  be just really a scary book you know there   be no natural world leave right all the natural world be go in nineteen seventy five his premise be basically this and now that um as soon as the world hit a point where there be no more objectively pristine land unhunh when you know they find pollution on top of mount everest right mhm and at the very bottom of the ocean right food well that   be it food mhm man have have some effect on the entire absolute absoluteness of the globe right so in principle the concept of nature as a system inside of which man live be over mhm right and then in practice since then which be fifteen year ago mhm man have have such dramatic impact on what we use to think of as nature that that the only way to coexist with nature it   be no longer nature the quasi religious overarching order principle right inside of which mankind live wordsworthian nature mhm and uh you know w a a thing that we can all rely on as a balancing force over and above ourselves to order the universe forget all that mhm woo that   be spicy it   be now shit you know the world be gon na be keep in order by the same people that bring you cough cough cough you know cough the atomic bomb right and cough cough all that stuff right right which just do   not sound like a very practical proposal yeah wow you know the same people bring you the extinction of all the large mammal in europe and america and the dodo be now entrust with maintain what   be there the rest of the natural world maintain the entire globe for the rest of time mhm right not likely mhm so

premise be not that mankind ca   not survive on earth right his question be it   be just it   be a whole different earth can mankind spiritually survive right in a metaphysical world in which it be patently obvious that man be the high active principle mhm you know outside of completely faith base belief in god you know which be irrespective of any relationship to nature mhm there be now absolutely nothing in the world to which we be beholden and he w his question be what impact be this gon na have on the sort of fuck up the animist cultural growth right of of the human specie mhm do we even want this right do we want to be the guy in charge of the world unhunh on the other hand be   not he say its too late well he be kind of say its too late so this be why its such a depressing book right he   be say we already do it and we have   not even think about so much for culture whether we want to do it or not right this be typical yeah you know and and then it get down to s you

you do   not want it sit around before it go on your lawn right right stuff from the sink yeah cause the stuff from the sink would be great for your lawn if it could get right out there right yeah but then it would be sit there sort of decompose or do its thing all over the lawn instead of in a nice little compost pile yeah so that   be well mm well not if you be careful i mean you know if you if you if you do   not have if you be really careful about your dish right and scrape em off yeah and it be just runoff mhm yeah well that would be good cause all of that stuff should go into the compost

sirenstartsindistance so whether the paper get in or not i do   not know but um you ca   not go and ask her well i k keep call the office and say do you have this form and they   would tell me no and

form what   be the deal unbelievable they   be just give i think it sound like to me they   be give you a lot of shit for no reason well they really be pick on the fact that i   be new like y uh it   be really annoying the fact that you   be new uh uh that i i would i would go further than that i   be not certify and yeah sirenstop it   be like the teacher and coop this last week ca   not first they   be like first i only have fifteen kid right and the legally you have to have eighteen hisd rule have it that you have to have at least eighteen right so i   be the only permanent sub i   be the only teacher who   be not experience who   be not certify who just start teach all these other teacher be old hand i mean they   have all be at it for at well chris be the least experience besides me but still he   be you know he   be have his certification and he   be have a year and stuff he   be real good at it so they do shit like first they tell me like i find out accidentally from the other teacher the principal do   not even tell me first she hire me n like the friday before school start and expect me to get my room ready and then and then i find out on thursday in the first week of school that i might lose my job yeah you tell me come friday yeah and and then th so i come into class and they   have put like all these third grade student in there do i tell you about that no it   be really annoying what they   have do to meet the l the they split it third and fourth little technicality that they have to meet yeah they just split the whole thing challenge yeah it   be well it   be something it   be twice as much work for you it   be something for experienced teacher it   be not for me you know it   be like really hard for me because you know and then you have to n and then that   be what i be do when i be student teaching i have split fifth sixth well they do   not even give me any text coop i mean i be the only teacher in the whole school who do not have textbook you know mhm because they be fuck me around so hard so then on the on friday i have eighteen kid i   be like great you know and all these teacher be come in and say well my child be on your role but i   be gon na keep him in my class q you know mm and i have these three third grader you know but the shitty thing be that they pick what the teacher do be they go oh well this this kid be bad behave i mean he   be he   be really stupid i   will just send him over to the new instructor of course so they s so these be of course the kid that i receive be the three third grader of the low education that nobody want and the bad conduct right and so th snort meanwhile in the principal   be office they   be tell me carolyn sorry i just get a visual sharon stand in front of the class go scream aw sometimes i   be like that while these little kid kinda l senorita flinn l hee hee hee hee hee oh thump miss flinn miss flinn miss flinn q you know towards the last couple of day i   be like i put up a list of rule and all day long i go back to the rule do not pull on my clothe and they get up out of the chair and they come up to me miss flinn miss flinn q and i   would walk over by the rule and i   would point to number two and i   would just look at them and they know what number two be do   not get out of your seat without permission you know so they   would look at me and they   would go god they   would go back to their chair on the last day that i be there like it be so awful because boy you   be a hard ass i have to become a hard ass the people w all the teacher be tell me could be bad you   be too nice you   be too nice your kid be gon na take advantage of you and they be th they k yeah they come to where they   would be talk the whole time during the assignment ah i   would be up at the board they   would be ts ts ts ts ts i   would turn around they   would go ah q hee hee hee q cause they do   not think i be serious and i finally get to the point where you know every day i   would have em put their head on the table for ten minute snort hunh you know with the with their eye close time out quiet time and i finally get to where i withhold recess and on the last day i keep th four kid after school yeah you know but you can only actually keep them over for like five minute cause they have like bus to catch and stuff well i   be tell you withhold goody work because they   will get kind of surly sharon i do that but if you give them reward well i give them st i give sticker you know to the k to the kid and i put excellent and i give sticker to the kid and the one that get good grade that get one hundred and ninety eight and ninety six i put their paper up on the board well there be other thing you can do besides um um you know you can make up goody you do   not have to spend money on goody you can have like you can make these little um do they have a laminate machine in the school not in the school but in this other lovely place well wh wh make these little pass or something that say one one free lunch with the teacher or one free lunch to sit with whoever you want at lunchtime i get to sit with my friend at lunch or what think up whatever little privilege like that um if there   be anything in the classroom that they really like to do have that be a privilege that nobody can do unless they have this pass and then give those pass out for good behavior at the end of the day i have an idea choose the mister samuel way of teaching take them by the hair boom head against each other or you can walk up to the chalkboard and you get really good so you go and you practice on the weekend get chalk from the chalkboard and you just f peg f it at their face pow you know i remember and you and you practice finally that man be fire man it take them how many year they fire him oh mister samuel he k sh god he be the most man he threaten little kid we   would all be sit in a circle and it   would be current event time we   would all be sit there he be harsh and one little kid eli goodman would just give him he be just talk eli be just talk mister samuel must have have a really bad day he come up alright you little shit i   be gon na f throw you against this wall fq and he threaten it he threaten to throw the kid thumagainst the wall thump and we all hear it and we all go home and tell your parent freak out no because w we be too scared to do anything and we would and our parent would go oh he   be a great guy q and they   would go and visit him and he would put on the bullshit and he   would be fine and no one believe the kid you know he be a man who would walk up to two little boy that be talk and grab their hair and slap actually bang their head together wh what a guy wh he pick ken romig up once by the hair i remember that yeah ken who   be like be actually very well behave you know and and really smart student go on to be one of those overachiever you know just yank him up by his little blond hair by the hair yep we be all like oh but he wo   not do anything to the girl if they give him backrub that   be right that   be right mister samuel have like the most what a jerk man unethical sigh classroom i can ever remember he be a fool he be an absolute fool i remember the the student i remember muffin be terrify that she be go to be put in his class his daughter his daughter actually admit it to me i see sally samuel admit what who be pregnant and have about you know let   be not discuss it but i be like um what do she admit how   be your father q i be kind of crude but i be like so what be your father do right now be the man dead yet q no i be just very kind she go well he he get fire q and and i say oh really now q that   be a surprise l que lastima l and the guy that he threaten to throw against the wall be put forward a year eli graduate a year before i do see i do   not understand that it be a hush hush deal do   not make any sense it w it be really weird well he   would like eli   be parent probably try to get him transfer out of his class his classroom be like and that be the only way to do it no doubt crazy no doubt that man be insane definitely insane hey coop what i be gon na tell you about that really frustrate me be that uh that the people principal and stuff they say to me oh well what you do with those third grader you know be you just like take them and put them you know with one of the smart fourth grader who   be very verbal uh and and well behave and you have them work as a team you know so that the fourth grader can help the third grader q but that   be bullshit because that just teach the third grader with the less intelligence that that he   be worthless you know that he ca   not learn stuff on his own no it   be not no it   be not you can put them in team like that but you do   not put one with one you put like two fourth grader with how many third grader do what   be the ratio of third grader to fourth grader but they   be not you mean so they do   not feel single out now i have like five third grader or what i have like t twenty two kid okay so you have fifteen fourth grader and five third grader na uh no i have like seventeen fourth grader and five third grader all you have be twelve kid what you only have twelve kid no seventeen oh okay fourth grader so then what you do be you sprinkle the fifth grader out evenly and you make the fourth grader take the responsibility for teach them third grader and you engrain in them that it   be their responsibility to help those little kid that   be what i do i have be but and it work can you can you say it   be part of your grade as long as it   be part of your ff yes ff oh yes corporate or you bet what do you call it well the third grader you tell them that their ability to cooperate be be grade coop well the third grader be just like y they   be get a grade in cooperation you know except for a couple who who be real smart wh darn wh that would be so hard feel like uh you know they   be incapable i mean th they just feel like well the fourth grader try and lord it over em too and the fourth grader will try to just like give them the answer there   be nothing else you can do about it and it   be hard for me to keep track of that you know i   will be like do   not give them the answer stand over i want you to help them understand but do   not just give them the answer q it take a long time to teach em how to work together i if i ca   not teach these kid you know i go around to the third grader i try to teach them individually what a noun be it   will start to happen by january sharon snort i mean it take a very long time it   be not easy to do i   am not gon na be there until january have have you explain to them like the speech about make mistake be part of life that speech and sigh what   be the other speech the other speech be i   have give them everything um do   not give away do   not give away the answer because you   be d deny them of learn mhm if y if you put it to them in a very simple way and they get it and they kind of go yeah well what you want to do be when you have them in group work on something i have i have it should   not be multiple choice it should   not be it be   not something easy they should they should have to write it out have some discussion go on like give them something to work on that there be no answer to but the other fourth grader it   be like that be just opinion they   will learn just as much you know they do   not really wan they do   not want to help the kid they they wa you know they   be do and they want to play and they get upset with me if i expect them to help the third grader help em to learn the basic tough and they do   not have the patience too bad this be the funny one or the psychology yeah to learn how to teach the kid well when you   be subtract you bring the one over and then that become ten and then you have to cross it out it become a nine god and then you bring the one over i could   not do it you know i could   not do it and these the thing be that the teacher that have these third grader before and a lot of the fourth grader really fail as teacher cause they do   not teach them diddly jack they should have learn that in the second grade in the in the second grade i learn my time table in the third grade i know th fourth grade be i have them memorize up until twelve fraction i fail these kid ca   not do their time table the fourth grader even well they   have just you know they   have be i have one student you know who know his time table up until ten wait they hey the teacher have just be pass them along wait a minute neither do i yeah i do   not know them either i do   not know time table till s like fifth grade only cause i be a dufus but well be no it be because you be a lazy butt i could not i could not do fraction i could not do fraction and i mean with samuel as a teacher who want to tell them who want to go up to this man and say i have a problem gasp you do   not really have mister samuel do you oh hell yeah oh i think you get out of be in his class unh unh i have him my whole fourth grade year and then there be a possibility the following year that he be go to teach fifth grade cause our fifth grade teacher be leave so all of us be like shit in our pant go no please no q we just we lucke out man but we get missis lindberg who be like the first granola woman i ever meet granola woman sigh she would say clap let   be go on a field trip we   be gon na go on a hike but but to try and and talk me out of believe in murphy   be law by offer a miracle as a replacement that do   not d work well you   be right i think they   be probably flip side i mean who be you but i   be pollyanna hardly hardly look where i   have come from i mean this chapter on heaven an hell it   be really interesting why i use to have this sort of standard line that there be two thing i get out of my marriage one be a name that be easy to spell and one be a a child that really get me ground but the fact of the matter be that the marriage itself i mean as hellish as it be it   be like it pull me under like a giant octopus or a giant giant shark and it pull me all the way under and then and there i be it be like the silent scream and then then i find that i be on my own two foot again and it really be s what be hell in that that marriage become become a way out for me it be the flip side it   be like sometimes you go through thing and you come out the other side of them wh you wh come out so much well and if i have   not have that if i have   not have it   be not the way with food what do you mean what go in one way do   not come out kay come out very hellish yeah very hellish so what do that have to do but it   be so goodgod k so good go down th i mean what do there   be there   be the opposite again it   be it   be ma the food be like all unique hey and wonderful i it   be major league yin and yang and heavenly major league what do that have to do with heaven and hell in the book well i   be just sort of reiterate i could read you some no i mean be that allow no i i do   not want to hear anything out of a book with chapter call heaven and hell you do   not no nkay well then let   be talk about our vacation i   be gon na be close minded about it oh dear but that   be hell i do   not like the book the way i the minute i look at it you do   not no that   be cause you that   be because i have my own idea about it i guess that i   be pretty comfortable with ah i do   not like re i do   not like read book about what other people think about die and i consider myself a real free thinker when it come to that stuff well and that   be remember remember it in the movie in beetlejuice the handbook for the recently deceased yeah i mean book word i mean n they just become handbook you distill them and use them in your own way no p no no i do   not i do   not i i come up with my own idea about that stuff and where do you get the idea think and where do you get those thought process what go on around me well be   not a book part of what go on around you well more from an oblique source you know when you   be read fiction or or article or history or something like that but but t for me it   be very difficult to pick up a book about death that someone   be write about death because it   be bullshit well who know what death be what d what what this man have put in the boo you have   not read the book one you have   not read the book so you do   not know i have   not read the book so i do   not know yeah but i do know it it   be an awfully it   be it   be an awfully presumptuous thing but to sit down and write a book about death d when you have   not die it have it have it have story in there from from the zen and f it just pool on other different well the zen can be bullshit too different source i mean whoever write the book of zen be   not dead either well f it might all be bullshit f but you g you g you   have get ta pull these idea from your environment and what   be go on before th th the thing i know most about life and death come from from my grandmother and have go through all that with her and then it be interesting cause read i do after that substantiate that experience for two month prior to her death do i tell you this that she dream about um she have this dream of fall off a building down o just like that that cartoon we see fall yeah the animation cartoon yeah yeah yeah and it be like that and that   be what she be dream about and then she say that she dream about um all of her relative that have die she be   not dream about anybody who be live but who have die and i read that later you know it be much later i read that in a book where um people who have technically die and then have be revive see relative come for them i   have read that course that may be what happen prior to the big the big nothing so why be you read a book about die i do   not know p you do   not know i have an interest in it why you   be alive why be you read a book about die i   have always be interested in it w why w i mean you know you ask someone why they   be interested in electronic and they can probably tell you well i do   not know i guess it must fo some reason i be fascinated with that movie last night with with uh lilian gish and b and bette davis i could   not believe these two old i do   not know i wan na say windbag ha but what happen to them i here   be betty davis i mean sarah z yeah this incredible film legend and we think of her in jezebel we think of her you know smoke cigarette smoke into the face of william holden and and the like i do   not i   have never see those movie you   have never see betty davis movie you   have hear kim the song betty davis eye sure and she   be get she get the woman   be get a rep yawn and so she she live and yeah i guess it   be j look at my mother too i n what do that have to do with why you   be read a book on death i   have always be interested in death f why f why wh wh yeah i   be laugh what be i   be think one thing my mother always use to say when i would   not go bicycle with my father pamela you be she would say you be she would say you   will be sorry when we   be dead q because you would   not bicycle mm because i would   not go bicycle with my father oh so i w it   be it   be you know and i h i bit my tongue the other day because remember you say to deven well i really want to spend time with you yeah and then we go to the chalk fair and then he take off with tobias the chop fair the chalk oh the chalk fair unhunh and he take off with tobias yeah be that that that i want to say with him well your dad want to spend time with you today and why do you run off and i do   not because i remember that my mother try to guilt me the same way so that   be why you   be interested in death sigh yawn maybe it   be because my parent be old when i be young very very young i   have always think it   be weird that we   have be i look down at my body and i feel like i   be in a spaceship yeah wh wh i just that   be why you   be interested in death n and i just think it   be so damn weird we   be here yeah yeah well it be and and i be construct inside of some woman   be womb and i be burp out so so you   be run you   be run down the road all the way to the very end hunh n you   be you   be you   be already stand at the end of the road try to figure out what happen there well n n maybe i maybe i   be just eager to get back to where i be may back into the womb no no no i maybe maybe this whole lifetime be just a really rude interruption of what of what of whatever it be i be do before i be before my number come up and i be tell i have to come back here what if what if unhunh what if worry about that see this be what you tell deven well what if worry about that have get in the way get in the way of you make positive choice for yourself in your life instead of just worry about w that you   be here and make the good out of it be here be be so illusive sometimes i mean illusionary those be two different word and they mean two different thing well it   be illusionary i take back what i say about illusive y you may be elusive well mm yeah but but but to me the whole point be be you have no idea what happen before or after you have no idea you can read book about it and you can talk about it but the most pragmatic thing to do be to just live it hm learn the rule of the game play the game for what for whatever you want for whatever you want be a doctor or a screen writer or an actress or a philanthropist or an explorer an explorer do what you want with the time you have learn give whatever love love love could i love you could i love you while i   be here do   not make light of what i   be say no think about the kid what be who be who be these kid w who be these kid w these little seedpod that have be send our way well sometimes for me they be a whip and a hairshirt wh wh they   be little little little lesson yeah ah yeah i mean sometimes i have to be real prep gasp what natalie ask me about santa claus today what do she what do she say in the laundromat she say mom santa claus be   not i mean d be there a for real sa santa claus i say a for real santa claus you mean a man who live at the north pole she say yeah i say no and she say well who be the other one i say well they   be the spirit of santa claus and they represent santa claus they they   be a picture of santa claus they   be santa claus   be agent they   be picture of santa claus be my mike on unhunh oh okay it sure be and you just damn near break the damn needle there and then she say and then she say well who fill the stocking and i kind of i say love fill the stocking oh god pamela she say she say oh you mean adult adult who wan na show you how much they care and i say yeah adult adult around who love you fill those stocking and i say she say but some adult talk about santa claus i say that   be because they wan na believe in santa claus and that   be what i tell her i say i wan na believe in santa claus in fact sometimes i do believe in santa claus and that that really satisfy her f but i think it be very pragmatic of her to ask about that in june f yeah but what d i think to myself if she ask me that like on christmas eve well she must have get some sort of a signal somewhere today in the laundromat i mean what do that have to do with death wh wh well we be talk about death and illusion the illusion of this life you know i i i my favorite word when i be twelve be paradox why because i think any word that be define i mean i remember the definition that i learn in seventh grade that be paradox seemingly contrary seemingly p seemingly con and i have a hard time with the definition so i think god a word that i   be suppose to learn and i get this definition and i do   not even understand the definition the definition of the word paradox be by design ambiguous chew on this one an ambiguous paradox be that redundant yes groan groan wh wh well that be age twelve so that be very close to deven   be age when i sort of bit my tooth into that one bit your tooth hunh and then yeah as i go i take a bite be be that like cut it in the nip i i get a little ahead of myself yeah i guess you do oh god i hope this do   not all sound real stupid well from from twelve to seventeen then that go from paradox to the invisible interfacing with the visible hunh the invisible interfacing with the visible face comma or period for everything you see you can look at me and i   be a body you see eye you see body you see hair you see slap s get your hand off me you see all those thing right yeah but there   be there   be me inside that   be invisible it   be not it   be it   be n it   be it   be i mean what if what if you take the same spacesuit and you put another spirit into it it would be a different person it   would say let me out laughter laughter it would be a different person you   be right i would   not be me right that   be right it   would be a different personality so i i i think it   be very fascinating of course that   be a hypothetical how do you know that it   be very interesti maybe may maybe maybe maybe the spacesuit have something to do with with who   be inside of it i mean you do   not know that would   not that be f a fascinating experiment a well no because look a gene genetic makeup it   be prove and that   be part of the spacesuit if you wan na use that that that your genetic makeup largely determine who you be you mean the chemical bath i sit in yeah as it be hm sort of dictate how i feel about be in this spacesuit yes yes right r you know and it depend on your brain dolphin level and my brain dolphin mm that   be sweet you know hunh i depend be yeah yeah a lot of it have to do with the with the the r five dollar and ninety eight cent worth of chemical and compound that make you we could spend a lot of our life try to to contradict that f why f well because it may be a very bad chemical bath we may b be put into something that   be completely acid to our true essence yeah but we have no choice in that matter and we spend a lifetime that   be right n well no apparent choice no choice that we know of mn yeah hm hm y yeah but but rather than than i mean i   be not i   be not i   be not all bent out of shape about it but i   have just but i be thi you   be just really interested in death my yearning my yearning my yearning be n maybe not to run ahead and and and and get to the exit as w i mean maybe it   be the yearning for where i be before i be bear well how be write read a book write by some schmuck who think he   be an expert on death well he may or may not be a schmuck darryl anyone who sit down to write a book about death with the hope of enlighten his fellow human being be in my book a schmuck well now them   be fightin ' word boy you could who the hell be someone anyone who   be live to sit down and write a book about death now really you know it   be like it   be these this this be the person who fall under that that category of expert that i disdain so much i know a lot about maybe he   be a very old soul please like old king cole comma or peroid laughter laughter hm well if he   be a very old soul he should keep it to himself you know i feel l after gretchen die it be all rather unfair i mean the tide at work just sweep over her so quickly and it be like but really not so quickly it be yeah p i mean it be something that have start in her a very long time ago she be go in less than five month six eight month and it just amaze me i mean you ca   not drag on and on and on about a fellow creature who   be go but i still miss my grandmother and i i certainly miss my dog

like a good idea somebody that could sit there and take order and listen to what they have to say and how they wan na do it part of the problem with this whole thing be that uh how i see it be that ellen be not relinquish t her duty to let hector go ahead and run it jake be feel threaten sc because associate producer be suppose to run editorial and b it make sense hector have an emmy nomination i would let him run editorial i would let him do anything he want to do in editorial they clip his wing they would   not let him do anything there be three show in trouble he be not allow to help on any of em none of em that   be change now though he can be like he be before again yeah edit and the neurotic be out well what   be gon na happen that he be editorial period cause st stevie   be suppose to leave in february so unless they f they they have to look for an editor rosenblum   be come back though be   not he i do   not know what he   be gon na do he want to work actually feature

nice little north or south of sunset oh south of course way down oh they   be right off of pico and i know how crass true cuz but it   be in right next door be ted rich who   be uh one of the biggie at mtm or lorimar or mgm oh i forgot which one one of them one of those place it all mean the same to me you know really i can never tell the difference mtm mgm lorimar except one day hector be s you know they be score the show last week and i and i call up to talk to him and i could hear the um the musician in the background tune up their instrument and then you know and it   be okay to talk to hector i could hear him a little bit but not too well but you know i still could talk to him and the next thing you hear all these horn blare so he say lina i have to go no shit i ca   not hear you at all sweetheart call me when i can hear you it be funny that   be the only part i   will miss so but his position be pretty uh stable yeah fletcher well see actually fletcher be go to ask hector to move back to editorial but he do   not know how to approach him cause he think he be so thrilled about be associate producer but hector really hate it so hector   be the one when be it two weekend two

fletcher i want to go back to editorial i say okay go ahead q so he call fletcher and fletcher be so relieved cause he want to ask hector to move back to editorial he   be just happy he do it why do he want to ask hector to move back to editorial because he   be so unhappy with the editorial staff that they could   not get what they want out of sherry and they could   not get what it they want out of seppie it   be actually not seppie   be fault it   be kind of they need to work with him more but that sherry be impossible she be a witch and then her assistant pull stunt where she do   not do stuff that everybody know assistant do which i would   not know but cause i   be no assistant but thing like make sure that the script get to the people do the sound effect so that they can follow along and make certain that their sound effect be go in the right spot that kind of thing she totally screw up the the show that they   be work on now i do   not know what number that be sylvia what show be be show now well it   be the one they   be work on v the one they   be work on   be not always the one that   be be show no but what one be tonight tonight i do   not know four five six this i i do   not know we   will have to ch oh this be the second one in the new season hm but i do   not know if this be really number two hm how they place it or if it be like like you say number three four or five because they have such a b hard time with it like last week   be be   not suppose to be show even though it be suppose to be number one because it be so poorly do it have so much wrong with it hector keep try to get it correct like a month ago and they keep stop him stop stop stop stop cause of her cause of her cause of jake nixon he do   not want him to do it and it make him look like an idiot cause he   be the director and you can tell where he   be miss the shot have nothing whatsoever to do with anybody else it   be jake but he   will s he   would cut off his nose to spite his face that   be stupid so now fletcher   be start to realize what   be go on it   be hard because the hatchet man actually in the group be ed ed   be the one that   will come in and he   will go ahead and say this be what need to be do okay and h or he   will look at you and he   will go that be a stupid thing to do why   would you do that q you know make the editor really stop and think or make whoever it be stop and think the director but fletcher   will kind of sit there and kind of go well mhm well let me see that that seem to be okay but i   will have to think about it he   be real wishy washy he   be too uh namby pamby you need somebody to come in and go pow pow pow yeah tso they   be kind of suffer that from that this year not have that on there but fletcher   be have to learn how to be more assertive otherwise his show   be just gon na go down the tube yeah and they ca   not afford that right now how many country be it in do you know m m all i know be cathy see it in

person that you have the complaint about i   be also go to suggest weekly house meeting to discuss such thing mhm oh yeah yeah you know what it would be a real good lesson for them too in self assertiveness yep you know and especially the way um i mean tim get in himself into a uncomfortable situation or whatever and his first reaction be to blow up about it mhm you know cause he let he let it pile up yep he do   not do nothing positive about it and then he just blow up and if something bother you you go and you i be like last year i be really proud of myself when i be ask to take over intermediate algebra unhunh and teach it drink drink and i do drink and i also go drink and i ask for a raise instead of cause instead of just sit in the class and get five dollar an hour i be now gon

singlehandedly there with one wrecker g yeah seem like any time i   have see a wrecker out here there   be always two guy in there hm m everyone be go when the call come in oh and jay   be not suppose to go on those anymore because of his heart so he have to send ron by himself and ron be slowly pull everybody out of the ditch do they all hit each other or just kind of a a semi bump a car and then go and go on two wheel and just about lose it and then get back up on all all its wheel again oh do it land in the ditch but it kind of it be able to get out but all the other car that be in the direct vicinity all hit the ditch and then there be three car and the semi and then this uh this guy pull up and drink he be go to uh peggy yawn yawn you remember peggy white yeah her husband gary bighare mhm him and her pull up and they be in the van and they stop to ask ron what happen and here another car come and rear end em oh and they end up have to take um peggy white by helicopter to billing man that   be pretty bad i know darn this darn dog keep breathe and like dream you know i wonder if we should wake her up no she   will get scared and want to go outside kinda nervous you know they say you can really mess up a dog by wake em up when they   be dream really mhm it   be so cold outside but yet sometimes she insist on stay out there i know you know what i be think of do hunh i do   not know she   be kind of shy but i be wonder what it would be like to train her to pull a sled i do   not know if she   would do it i do   not know if she would either she   be kind of timid mhm she do   not trust too many people at all yeah oh and you know another thing that tim have the audacity to bitch about what he say um mandy have to stay up all by herself and decorate the tree until four in the morning and i even ask if we could put our ornament on there and they tell me that there would   not be enough room really mhm tim say that she be probably lonely when she be do it you know that she probably be i sit up with her and i be talk to her she be do all the decorate i mean what be i gon na do she i mean she be just put up the ball and everything and she   would say where where do you think this should go q and so i be sit there do my welfare application and uh you know i be just sit there watch her tell her where to put everything and what not do you know nickie want her own tree yes and i forgot to bring it in it   be outside what be you gon na do with it she want to set it up for her barbie i be just gon na use a tin can and put rock in the bottom mhm and just stick it in there and you know what i do hm i do   not want to waste a tree   be life so i just cut a branch off one god i fall up there drink where   would you go to get em you know where sarah and arvela live mhm just around the corner remember that first cattle guard you go over unhunh i do   not even go over that you mean kinda like by the by the tunnel right below the tunnel oh and i just walk up we just walk up around uh that area god alice that be fun do you get grandma a tree too hunh unh do she already have one hm m that pickup could only hold like three mm i wonder why do daddy say to take the pickup back or what be the deal yeah yeah why cause phoebe need it what   be wrong with the car oh you do   not hear about it hunh unh oh you do about how the engine be on fire mhm see there be oil spill out leak out from the valve cover mhm the valve cover gasket apparently crack or whatever and there be oil come out and the oil get hot and you know how it get hot and smoke mhm well i guess enough come out because we be lose oil bad go from billing to crow um there   be a lot of drink smoke come out and by the time we get to hardin we have to put like uh three or four quart in unhunh it be three and by the time we get to crow it be it be one quart low and there be smoke still come from under the engine i figure w if it be lose that much oil then it catch fire mhm cause the engine be hot cause there be   not enough water in the radiator mhm i talk to oscar about it and he say well i check it be only it be only about i   would say a half a quart to a quart short of water but that should   not make any difference he go the only thing i can think of be that there be an air lock in there and that run the engine out on the open road mhm cause that air lock to come through flush it out and bust the gasket no it would more or less um the engine be   not be keep cool enough cause there be   not enough fluid in the radiator drink unhunh and you know how the radiator   be the pipe   be close to other part of the engine yeah so what it be some part in there cause the fire the engine be too hot and the oil leak so he know that the oil be leak no we know we be lose oil but we do   not know where i just figure it be from that valve cover gasket just from lift up the hood and look at it so what   be he gon na do well and two of his wire the sparkplug wire unhunh be fry all the way through unhunh so we take those off and we replace them with some old one out of the garage i know that and it run it run there   be enough uh radiator fluid in there mhm so that it will it   be it   be enough mhm drink but i think run it out on the open road will cause it possibly to shoot more oil out mhm that valve cover gasket have to be replace hm i do   not know oh i freak cookie and rita and gary out tonight remember the plain plainfeather uh claypit where that red clay be mhm right there i see my my speedometer just go brr like that just down you know and i know exactly what it be what i have to do be take off the distributor wire and splice it in with the fuel pump wire mhm because my fuel pump be now electric never use to be mhm hand me that ashtray or your light i mean your light p it   be behind the sew machine and uh sometimes it get loose yawn and no more fuel yawn unhunh so i stop the car and they say what be you do i say oh i get ta tighten this wire here q so i have cookie turn on the ignition and turn it off so cause see once you turn that key on then you hear the the fuel pump come on mhm and if the wire   be not connect right it do   not come on mhm so i do that and i light a match to find out where i be and n after everything be hunky dory then i shut the hood and get back in and i start up the engine and both gary and rita be sit on the edge of their seat and i turn around and i look and i say do i scare you kid q they would   not say anything then gary go yeah i be scare q but i freak em out i do   not know then daddy say something about the steering column on my car need matchstrikework mhm say long as i do   not drive it fast it should be alright but oh man i do   not know see the thing about it be if i go after ken

least be able to put gas in the car mhm and go do something i do   not think it   be such a good idea for you to go up there in the winter mm i   have be think about that we should all get some money together and be there any way he could like meet us in great fall or something cause i   would like to go up there and go to the um red lobster really yeah cause i   have be just crave seafood that   be the half way point he could do it yeah i bet he could do it when though i do   not know he go back to school like the second oh shoot well be   not there any way like we that we could just meet him up there and maybe what bring him down bring him down or i do   not wan na take your car drink i be gon na ask you and mom too if you could um take care of trace for a couple day next week oh what you get in mind i need to get catch up on my work drink wednesday i have an appointment at nine thirty mom   be off be   not she oh that   be right that   be right yeah i think that   would i think that

piss me off be would um be nicky mad when trace be a boy kind of she think i should have twin twin girl cough cough but i do   not think she   will realize the uh sible rivalry but i do   not know she   be six year old now and they say that if there   be six year between child there   be not that much rivalry after four there   be almost none really mhm cause they   be four be ideal they   be kind of in different world yeah because see trace will be the next time i have a baby trace will probably be about three four hm that   be when i   be gon na get this shit take out tammy kashen have one of

through here okay alright so he come through here mhm when he come through here do he look at you at all mhm initially yeah what do he do just look he have a do he stop walk n just kinda look and then look and then walk okay and then he keep walk yeah when he look at you the first time be he sort of look you up and down or do he just look at your seat what just like you know look uh i guess at you at me di okay yeah and look at my seat cause i always sit all the way to the window okay so i think he be gon na sit down actually okay hunh p and then he continue on unhunh and where do he go he go all the way to the you know into the train all the way up here mhm okay and then uh he go through the door and then he come back again okay he go through there he go through these door into it unhunh into another car oh and then he come back again and then i guess that be like another stop and more people be get off and then that   be when he come and sit by me sit in this seat right here but there be someone sit there too there be a lady you   be kid unhunh there be a lady sit there but she get up and she go to another seat ah she she just go to a different seat okay you know like but he be make i do   not know how you describe it you know how you can be like a nuisance to someone mhm or you may smell or something yeah you know like that you know yeah or move around you know like as he want her to move okay and she get up and move s she okay um and so when she move be there anybody seat in this area i think maybe like you know how these chair be unhunh maybe right here and you know okay but you could   not they could   not see nothing or anybody okay but nobody right no in these area i do   not believe so okay alright so then what do he do um do the newspaper you know look at it you know make loud noise i guess so i think like that or whatever then he just keep do that to the newspaper like that and then he go in and then he just you can just see him go like this you know how you have to unzip your pant yeah or something like that and i   be look through the window and then he   be still make noise with the paper and then um i kinda look and then i do   not and i keep make like s uh wh you know like wh q you know like i know what you   be q he be make noise like that no he be make those you know the rattle paper unhunh but i be make noise like q you know like i want him to know i know what you   be do q yeah you know i remember him for a year from a year ago and so then i just keep you know i just turn you know away from him and i look in the window and he just keep b hit the paper like that b you know but you know what he be do yeah he keep hit the paper and um uh let me see then one time i just you know kinda look over and then you can see it you know you can see it have he lift up the paper in any way or yeah just like clap you know i   be try to see how a paper go like thi like this okay like he have the paper like like this just like you know move it like that you know like that oh you know and you can see it okay you know be he look at you at all during that time yes the whole entire time okay i mean not look at paper first he would go like this even with the paper and look at me you know try to get my attention paper yeah like he want me to look at him and then the whole time under here he   would just look i mean he look so hard that it be like burn you know what i mean yeah it tell the jury that okay that   be i mean that   be great he just alright um because that   be what he do okay and that   be his way of draw your attention to him mhm because if somebody   be do that to you there   be no way you   be gon na you know just totally ignore them yeah cause you   be always go to wan na keep them in your peripheral vision at least yeah mhm to make sure where they be mhm yeah cause i be you know i do   not know what he be gon na do yeah or anything so so um part of our burden be to prove that he   be deliberately do th that he have the specific intent to draw your attention to him okay so let them know that he be do that okay alright um okay so then and then he sort of pull the paper aside and he   be still stare at you yeah unhunh still stare and just you know and then but when uh uh like you come to a stop see that   be all through the tunnel you know that   be a long like about mhm five minute ride or something a couple of minute ride and we got to like embarcadero paper he would just you know go like this you know paper before anyone get on and wait and then just do the same thing until i have to get off at my stop tell the jury about that too because that indicate that he know what he be do be wrong hm oh okay and if there be a chance that any man might walk by y mhm you know i have another case or i have a pr report from another case where um he wa he be crouch down and do it mhm and then when a man would walk by he   would sit up yeah and you know do nothing and then once the man be through the door then he   would go back do it yeah okay so um okay so then you get off at your stop yeah um and how be you feel well p it be like p crs i do   not know sorry you do alright just i do   not know like disgusted you know wh why i really want to report it this time because sob it be like summertime sob unhunh and the kid you know the kid and everything yeah that   be what i be scared of because i know how uh i be you know a victim of you know abuse like that or sob i just you know i just that   be what i be think the very first time i report it be just like this dirty old man just that that yeah and this time it be during the summer and there be lot of kid and um i just feel like you know upset you know yeah and i just you know i just feel upset okay you know n cry tell the jury that um it   be it   be really important that they understand the feeling that go through you when sombody do something like that to you cause my one concern about this case be um that some people may have the attitude of well he never touch you mhm he do   not make any verbal threat to you it   be no big deal q and especially i have some young single man on my jury panel mhm and i my worry be that they do   not relate to what a woman feel when something like that be happen mhm because their experience would be totally different if a man expose himself which a man would never do that mhm because number one they pick out i think more vulnerable people mhm but if um a man be to be expose to they would laugh or you know be disgust mhm or be mad but they would   not necessarily feel knockknockknock scared or threaten dooropen unhunh hi hi can i sit with you sure um so r relate that information to the jury doorclose okay okay um and then uh so then when you get off you call the police no right i go upstairs to the bart and tell them and i try to tell them what train it be and i just i be still kind of like shock so i i be like well i have to go cause i have to make an appointment q but i do tell someone i say i   will be back to make a report or whatever i have to do and then there be a different person down there and when i call the bart police they say oh no one   be even say anything to us q you know and uh yeah that be that and then i think uh couple of day after one of the uh detective call me and then i make a report he want to see if i can i would him first and then we just make a report and he say he   will submit it and everything okay and you id'ed him immediately unhunh he just show me he   be all okay come with me come with me q you know okay alright i have a and this be i if they make an issue out of it this be what you look at right mhm like a folder with different yeah yeah right there and i have the one where you sign right underneath it unhunh yeah and we   have get the statement where you immediately say i   be hundred percent sure this be the guy mhm yeah p so okay what be he a old man he   be like sixty in his yeah yeah god and he   be like bald like yeah you can come in the courtroom oh good okay yeah um she have anxiety attack when she get excited and see that   be why i   be s she get real nervous and scare that   be why i be tra unhunh she have bad anxiety attack i ca   not breathe she she   will ju oh really that   be why i   be try to yeah sh that   be why she   be cry okay so okay um m how do i have to look at anyone just you or no you can just look at me okay um when you go in let me explain to you what the courtroom   be like so you know what to expect okay um you you do   not have to you know and if you if you feel like you need to take a break mhm then tell me immediately okay um or ask the judge you   will be seat right near the judge okay um i be say to june that you know a lot of time people be intimidate by the courtroom and they think it   be really formal and it   be really not that formal mhm okay um the juror that be in there there   will be twelve people seat in the juror box mhm and um you know they could be your family they could be your friend mhm um they   be all y y from all walk of life mhm um they   be all different age and um they you know for the most part they be probably very nervous when they come in just for jury duty yeah so um they just want to hear your story and they   be not judge you okay um paper let me show you baby hm hm m mhm will it help to have him in there yes unhunh good paper she be go crazy all day here i think that   be him q every time every time she see a the whole time down here i be like q that ai   not him q i be do that that   be him that   be him q like that he be like oh no no it   be not him just come on q i do   not know where i draw it out throat so be he in like jail or something or he just show up for court no he   be out right now oh okay he will be oh okay at the end of this if the jury do the right thing alright um we ask for ninety day county jail before the case go to trial mhm and normally um it   will be high if he   be convict okay so plus he   be get your case pende in oakland oakland and if there   be a if we get a conviction just on one case here mhm then your case in oakland will be a felony oh okay so alright um okay yu w what will happen be you   will walk into the courtroom here mhm there be door right here yeah there be seat right here um that be for the audience but normally there   be nobody in the audience but okay your husband will be there um and then there be two table right here i   will be seat at this table mhm and the defendant and the defense attorney will be seat at this table mhm the jury sit here okay all in a row um then and you   will walk thr when you walk in you   will walk through and i   will walk with you okay um to the ch the witness chair okay okay which face out this way alright and the judge be seat right here alright right above you and then there   be a woman who sit here who   be the clerk and there   be a woman who sit here the who   be the court reporter okay and so when i ask you question when you   be talk you need to uh always say yes or no as oppose to unhunh q or unh unh q oh okay or nod your head okay because she take everything down okay um if your nervous please tell me okay or tell the judge and we can take a break okay if you want to get a drink of water or something like that okay okay um and take your time you know when you walk in just take a deep breath okay take your time if i ask you a question that you do   not understand tell me okay um if we either of us ask you a question where um it   be something you do   not remember it   be a detail that you do   not remember mhm it   be fine to say i do   not i do   not remember at this time okay okay um be there gon na b the other person his lawyer gon na ask some question yeah cross examine p he   will be able to ask you question also he   be he   be a very polite guy okay he   be a young attorney um he   be with the public defender   be office he   be um w when we have the case the last time it be a different attorney mhm and that attorney terrorize my my one victim that i put on um he walk up to her and he be about this far away from her mhm and sh cause she have testify when he walk in initially and he look at me walter munson she say i i know he be a pervert just by the way he look at me oh so this man walk up to him and he say i   be stand close to you i   be look at you do that make me a pervert q mhm and uh just badger her aw but this this attorney be not like that at all okay p he   will be very polite um wh mhm wh he   be go to try and focus more on uh discrepancy like if you testify to one thing and there   be something write differently in the report unhunh he might say well you know in your in the report it say that you um you know he sit down right across from you mhm immediately oh okay as oppose to walking or something like that okay which it do   not but okay um he   be gon na try and focus on little thing cause that   be all he can do okay but for the most part he   will be polite and gentle okay so you do   not have to worry about him hm um what hap well tell me about the year ago incident um that one be at night time and um i be work late and it be around i remember i use to get off ar around nine and i use to get to um the bart station around ten o'clock and he would be i think i   be try to think would he get on or would he already be on p well that   be the daly city one so he would get on when i would get on but i think probably like a different car and same thing exact identical go up and down the aisle but i would be the only one in the train you know because at night time there   be not many people on there and he would do that and i be i be terrify then because i be the only one there be no one around yeah i you know i be a little scared this time but you know but there   be people around like you know i do   not think he would do anything when people be around right you know down at the other seat or in back right i could scream but yeah at night time he be do the same thing and i call that night to the bart police and i tell them what he look like and everything and i never hear anything again so okay um do he use a newspaper that time also mhm so identical everything yeah okay and then i even tell them i say and the funny thing be he just the only thing he change this time be um he wear a new bow tie and uh a different bag hx cause he always have a bag cause the what make the interested in this case they s tell me well everyone   be tell me he have this bag he carry around and he have a bowtie like that and i go yeah that   be the only difference he have a different bag this time a year later and a different bow tie yeah and they be like okay q you know now the bag that he be carry around this time what be it m let me see i think a duffel bag i think okay okay one time it be a duffel bag and then one time it be like a uh what do you call them p like a sh like a old be shop bag yeah a shopping bag a plastic yeah yeah mhm that   be his common one plastic bag fill with paper okay yeah yeah in this one you say he   be carry a sho a duffel bag a duffel bag okay okay so you wan na have you read through your statement recently no do you wan na read through it yeah okay okay stretch hm p now you ca   not do anything to this guy oh i   be not i   be just gon na sit back and look mhm i   be a little worried about her cause she have them anxiety attack she just do   not have no control over her body wh train wh when will the verdict be um well it depend uh you two be my last witness and then the defendant will testify and then we could do closing argument today or it could be tomorrow and then w we should have a verdict by friday afternoon okay no later than friday afternoon so i   will call all of you and tell you be he gon na take the stand he say so mhm h what could he br possibly say br he testify in a trial um about five year ago sa identical situation really and he say his testimony be my momma do   not raise me to do thing like this he totally deny it mhm so so cause i be just tell him the same thing happen to my mom oh really yeah she be be it him i do   not know she just tell me that you know it be a long time ago you   be say five year ago yeah it be around that time and she tell me but he use to i do   not know she she do   not say anything newspaper whatever but he would do finish the job oh everything you know and oh so but she say she report it and no one ever do anything they   be hard case um to act on mhm and i think the reason why they finally start act on these and get the identification mhm be because so many of em be come in oh okay do you have any question june yawn no okay um i   be go to put june on first okay and then then rickie and then will you let us know what the final verdict be yes hm p definitely hopefully it   be good news if it   be not i   will be bum cause i   have be live with this case now for so long be i do that right so far mhm all the way down to that mhm wh i wh think i do   not think i be do you and you   would have to have that plus or minus what i do   not know what i do to get that where do i get that square root of um ex square because you bring this over here you bring three over here divide by three and then you have ex square so if you want to find ex you have the square root of ex square i guess all i ca   not figure out be what the square root of negative two thir thi two third be would that be i square root two i square root two third o over three the whole thing would be over three br well br no it could   not be square root of two third yeah but then you get the other one nathan oh wh gosh wh hm leah she snooze on the floor mhm not anymore you wake her up she   be do the karate kid nathan she   be like leave me alone do i deserve this i mean how would you like it when you   be lay in bed somebody just grab your arm start swinge it around i   would probably just slap em ex squared equal one over the square root of that the square root of that ex equal the square root of one p she   be not even look at me she   be just look like i know that   be what i   be talk about so would that one be square root of one half mhm it would mhm yep but do y' all have to do that um you have to like have it where you do that there   be no um fraction under the under the in the denominator i mean no fraction under the oh yeah so then you just multiply the whole thing by the square root of two and you get the square root of two over two even for the top one even for that one no for i   be talk about for this one oh all you do be like go t two over one you have the square root of one like that right m m since you have the square root of two on the bottom to make that a square you have to multiply by the square root of two and then you get two and you multiply the top by the square root of two and you get square root of two what i wan na rewind it and hear that back again cause i sure do   not catch it the first time you get the two and you take the square root of two and you get the negative two which you take the square and it come to two i   be sorry so let   be talk about this slowly as i write this down as you   be say it alright this be what we come out with right it   be but put it as the square root of one over the square root of two oh and then you multiply that by the square root of two over the square root of two right uh be that what all those square root of two be that   be what i be try that   be what i be try to say okay i be wonder where all that square root two square root two that   be what it be then right here you   would get square root of two over two mhm see everything be square root two over two and two right but then what about this one on this one let me do this one but you have i you have i square root of three over square root of three i mean z i square root of two over three square root of three i ca   not even say it right over do i have another i down here or just the one i um no just one okay three and square root of three over square root of three and you get p i square root of six yeah over three be that right i doubt it i really do i   be not kid you ca   not you ca   not multiply square root like that can you square root of two time square root of three be square root of six be it yeah okay well then that   be fine then that be right be   not that c you can do that yeah cause that   be the same way you   be multiply there square root of nine that and square root of nine equal three yeah okay p where   be the test there ai   not no telling p sigh you have it i mean i have it okay the next one be five ex time ex minus one cough cough be that it um equal two time one minus ex leah two time one minus ex yeah and that   be easy you can do that oh this be easy ex squared p please say this will factor will it na you do it well i mean that   be just waste time cause if it   be not yeah it do mhm one and negative two fifth mhm and i can always put those back up into the top and and see if they check right let me just try the one five i get zero equal zero tha that   be right and that   be one yeah zero equal zero equal one okay sing fingerprint file you get me down come on sing ex time hang on number eight ex time two minus ex two minus ex be less than or equal to i do   not like these three time ex minus four three time ex minus four right alright distribute first right mhm two ex minus ex square three ex minus twelve you get wh do that side so you get ex wh whoa i do   not want to do that negative ex square wh two ex minus two minus ex um plus twelve whp now do you factor this after you do that yeah yeah oh but first i get ta take out that negative one do   not i mean that negative mhm in front of that ex square so i just i can multiply that whole side by negative one again though yeah then you flip that sign over i have to flip that sign over if i do that mhm see it   be little rule like that that i   be not gon na remember so if it   be a if it   be less than or equal to then and there   be a minus you have to flip the sign okay be you tired not really i mean kind of but i   be gon na go home in just a few minute why p cause i can work on this at home and let you get some sleep hitsnathanwithpaper ouch okay s so you say ex plus four be great than or equal to zero so you say ex be great than or equal to negative four and ex p three or oh be that one of the one where you have to do or yeah and if it   be less than do you still do or no that   be if it   be um in the in the b in between those two number you know if there   be like a like this one do   not look but if there   be like a ex in the middle well no that   be a or if you have like one number on one side mm p and it say yes great than or equal to ex like and than l that one   be less than or equal to like two be less than or equal to ex be less than or equal to which be less than or equal to less tha less than or equal to six right so the final an so that   be the answer right mhm number nine p okay i do   not know this one so you do   not know how to do this one so we in trouble well you apparently know how to do it do i get it right well you do   not get the whole thing right but you well you just miss one part of it so what   be that problem um absolute value okay of one half minus ex over three ex over three oop okay be less i mean be great than or equal to two third just plain old two third mhm how do you get rid of the absolute value thing do   not you i do   not you put be less than or equal to two third or be great than i mean be great than or equal to two third and then do   not you have like i or be less than and be less than or equal to negative two third what can i see what i do yeah but when you when you have absolute value when you take the absolute value off and you put negative two third on this side too first i   will just get a common denominator so i can do that you ca   not do it when it   be in the absolute value though well i do right there be that why i miss it but see if you wan na do that then at first you bring so i only do one part of it in other word mhm just bring nega just bring two third over to the other side negative two third over to the other side and make it equal to zero no no keep that there but then have another one over there yeah have be less than or equal to negative two third and that   be not absolute value anymore well see we   have never do it like that let me see if that   be how you do it i mean i   be sure you probably can do it that way i do   not know if that   be how you do it or not cause i have   not do this in probably about as long as you have oop wh god wh it   be my own fault i should   not have wait so long to get math over with i should   have get it over with right out right out of high school gasp drink oo a bug hey leah she look so tired i know she   be eat that bug be that what she   be do yuck i guess yeah that   be how you do it you can do it that way mhm burp let me see the pencil but then i do   not get what she get i guess she yeah you can put it so wh square root of that wh oh no it   be not gon na work that way you do   not have it in the middle see i put it in the middle seven half be great than or equal to but you ca   not put it in the middle cause if it   be gon na be g yeah if it   be gon na be great than that then it   be not gon na be less than that well i guess it can wh god wh so one way i could do it well s no wait a minute now see l look what she do she um flip that sign over but uh when she you divide by negative two you have to flip all the sign over which you k do yeah cause you get that right it   be right here oh gosh you know what i   be just gon na skip this one no you   be not you   be gon na do it now so i ca   not start by d unh unh not find a common denominator you have to ha bring well i can do find one side by do that ca   not i yeah but why do   not you p just put the other put once you have negative two third on the other side then you can find a common denom f na buh buh buh buh common denominator for the whole thing and it   be gon na be the same denominator well what   be the common denominator of bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh i do   not mean that i mean once you bring it over there i know what you mean i do   not ever remember us do anything like that though well add it onto the other side q there   be like a way you always can get rid of those absolute value bar in problem be   not there hey can i use some of this oh yeah mm see yeah here it   be absolute value right here and it   be do it the way that you be do it i   be try to find one like that one see that   be the problem there   be so many different type that i   be sit here st worry about this one right here and there probably wo   not even be l one like this on the test i know there   will be a different one so what do you do you find a inequality with an absolute value in it which there   be one right there mhm see i sure do   not see any in the example hm m see there   be no there it be see here it be absolute value of that you bring bring negative four over to the other side okay p and all that see that just prove that she put problem on there that we   have never go over i know we   have never do one like that where you do that can you do you wan na do that when it   be less than or can you do that when it   be great than too yeah th either way so if it   be point this way you just put another one point this way over here right okay wh where   would you get that one wh that   be a big one you   be not kid that   be my thumbnail sigh yawn now i just get a common denominator for the whole thing mhm well take out those absolute value thing they   will screw you up yeah and now this   will be six right be that right mhm now what do you do subtract three from the middle and y to which side to both side to both side okay negative p two ex alright to one then after that you have to p take out the negative yeah divide by well just ta divide by negative two oh you ca   not get that by ex by itself yeah and when you divide by a negative you have to flip the sign yeah okay and when you do that it   be gon na be a or because if you look at it cause you know it ca   not be great than seven half and less than negative halve at the sa one half at the same time so it   be gon na be either ex be less than or equal to negative one half or okay will you pass me some of that tea please oh thank you drink drink number ten how many problem be on this test p twelve oh good what do you want to do after this test that   be it i guess you gon na study some more tomorrow then right oh definitely okay ex plus four over three ex minus two be less than zero wh be wh less than zero right sigh wh gosh wh be this the c be this the same class i   be take kathy be you sure we   be do work from the same class that i   be that i   be that i go to every night i do   not know be we it   be get the same name but that   be about it okay i do   not even know how you start this one do you yeah i think so but i   be not sure cause the way i start it do i do i have anything write on the test m m i leave it blank but but anyways back to the the first thing okay what we be talk about be yeah i   have get ta pick up pat i l i drop her off at the bookkeeper write uh uh i would prefer that write that you be there on one hand because i think that it would be most expedient but i think what be feel be that at this point rather than ha than create i do   not really f find it to be you know a confrontation by any mean but mhm i just think they wan na be able to just kind of figure out i think our board eh quite frankly we have more problem to resolve interior than we do outside of it hm i think most of it be just attitude hm i think you know like i say what we need to do be this board have to realize in my opinion that that they have to come to grip with the fact that they be responsible for basically what they   have create mhm okay you know mhm you ca   not th penalize somebody for m and the vetter be somewhat responsible that   be right and that   be uh mhm well it be far beyond our control well and the thing be i mean that uh we   be we   be a different board we be not the same yeah and we have to do that that   be right but we have to realize that there   be the fault here we have to claim responsibility i mean mhm i think there be there   be manner of of speak that i be very outspoken about at this meeting you know w that i talk to uh bill and carmela and nancy about you know and they we do they ask me to meet with them about teresa   be thing mhm that i find v really nothing to be honest nothing of any validity well i you know okay i have speak twice with teresa do you unhunh yeah and i tell her exactly well i t i simply tell her what what i know to have happ and i it   be to me it   be n just ludicrous and i anyway we w we go through the whole thing and uh and and i also say that it would probably be bring up at board retreat or di do   not know uh well i i   be gon na write a letter to teresa uh um just to tell her that l you know d thank you for your l you know y what you   have do for the board and so forth mhm and just say you know i   be hope we be gon na address this letter of concern that you   have give us mhm um she   be ask that you know she want she do   not really want her thing to be kind of everywhere you know those th mhm what her comment she really want em to be within this tap committee tap mhm my f summarize or something like that i guess s they be her summar her summary th you know she kyu very m very concisely yeah i do   not know if she put it together or if nancy put it together but mhm you know that just say they i d i really have a ho everybody there include nancy mhm you know uh have very little to to you know to agree with the validity okay yeah it be a matter of i just do   not you know see where this be come from yeah it   be okay you know these be these be root i know jeez obviously in a personal issue yeah um teresa be a very sensitive person she f you know i do   not i have no doubt that she believe what happen happen but well but my my feeling be as i tell them i say if it   be that issue i say you know i say let   be just get real here i say yeah we all know brad i say we all know teresa i say and i do   not know anybody on this board who do not tiptoe around teresa period yeah unhunh i say i do   not know anybody who would even go as far as to say anything of that nature i say and there it be very clear you know she keep say preface everything with you know this be not a personal attack this be not a personal vendetta yeah yeah yeah yeah right right which tell you that it be yeah that   be immediately what it say and that   be what everybody perceive it yeah there yeah there have be some uh i   will te well it go back to if you can believe it i ha i know she there be a a we have a number of people once at a party uh like half of the board it be a big mistake of mine yeah and i know she feel really snub and uh mhm and it be and i i call her in fact later and i say teresa thi this be not a w i invite people that help with the market that year mhm i think it be two year ago and i know i mean that wa really upset her and jeez if that   be gon na upset her uh well that   be that   be the thing that but anyway that see and the other thing that i   have get ta do too be i wan na make sure like for example donna   be aware that she be not gon na be at this retreat mhm see i have not call her but i   be gon na call her to tell her that mhm yeah you know we   be have a board retreat you know right that it   be not gon na include staff if that   be what we decide right unhunh and what we will do be i think what we   be gon na probably wan na do or what i would like to do be i would like to take a day mhm d during the week and we   will just take a whole day that day and myself uh if we have a uh facilitator mhm um that that person you and patricia and d donna mhm and maybe one other or two other board member would actually spend that day and just say okay this be what go on at that retreat mhm these be the concern yeah these be comment these be the one that we feel we can address these be the one that pertain to you unhunh yeah i i be concerned phil that you mention it yesterday that that there may be a number of question that just can not be answer without me be there yeah i i i think it   be hi l gato l you know i   be gon na have okay can we talk l uh i bet pat   be gon na she   be gon na start walk back to the office yeah i drop her at the bookkeeper w w why do   not you call me at least a little bit later maybe yeah and we can go do that can i do that cause i she   will be ji jim and i be gon na have lunch uh i do   not want to get her uh i do   not know if you have plan or not but we   be gon na have lunch later at noon sure hx if you wan na join us it   would be great sure yeah um you wan na do it where what   be the i you know i do   not my my feeling be i   be try to i think what i wan na do be my my point of want to push this retreat i think it be really important be mhm to do it to e to make it sound like we   be take it seriously oh yeah but to also put into perspective and see w that be one point of view why yeah you know like i say d d the facilitator in in the beginning i do not be   not really in support of one and only because i feel mhm i wan na make it sound important it would formalize it too much or i want it formalize it but it   be also say i want it to come to the resolution that thing be   not that bad mhm no and that what i what we and thing be   not that bad the thing be that we h do have our attitude mhm mhm okay mhm we have an attitude you know even what ray   be attitude with with barbara mhm be completely unheard of you know and i   be that bother me a great deal jeez i just could   not believe that when i hear it i i have you know i come real close to call ray and just sit and talk with him about it yeah but i figure no yeah i   be just gon na blow it off i think he   be off the board i   be gon na blow it off he   be i   be not gon na give m yeah you know we   have do everything we need to do right right i think you know what barbara tell me be that dolore be incredibly embarrassed by his display at this time in front of her dolore apologize for ray to him really oh gee so dolore be obviously aware that oh gosh you know and yeah she say i do   not know why he resign i do   not know what   be get in because he   be be miserable because w which we know mhm that   be why he be keep try to get involve and make it sound you know like he and nyou know he be try to make it sound like same old complaint same old everything well we do   not have any complaint yeah i think this be one of the first year i know that this have be so smooth and i think have we realize it mhm we would have allow him to take a break four year ago yeah yeah yeah because and it be   not so much it be   not you know like i tell jim i say it be   not anything that you do be   not anything else mhm i say it be a matter of you know mbrad do and pat do the organization i say which be the good thing i th i agree with that mhm i think that be the good thing to do mhm it be a lot of time yeah but i think we need to we need to d establish duty mhm you know which we decide and see part of what we decide with these duty be just decide what we need to do what you know there   be gon na be task mhm as specifically as we ca yeah see and i   be i   be on one hand i   would like to take it back to where the secretary be responsible for the minute unhunh you know pat do that yeah i know there   be really the secretary serve almost no function just i th not you know i it   be just uh there sign she sign her name thirty time yeah you know in the last f y right right phil two day ago well that be it that be it that   be a problem that um i you know and i think we wan na do that we need to say you know pat   be be great enough to do this and if she really want to do it i   be not gon na dissuade her from do it yeah but one thing we have to be careful of yeah that i mention to jim and i   have mention it to pat lightly yeah which be to be careful about say thing you know like in board meeting in interject too much yes okay i know because in board discussion i mean yeah o on one hand as a member she have every right to to speak what she want but mhm no but that   be the thing be you know i   have just see some of the look from some of the people you know who feel i   be a board member q yeah and whether the board you know if they do   not interject anything but whether they do or not i think we have to be careful mhm well phil that i mean that go be because where that come in that go for me as well then it yeah it do but it um i think what   be different be you um you   have be much more responsive in this sense i mean okay pat   be more opinionated in that sense you know i unhunh okay i what i try to do be be be just respond to question and if i need to fill in blank which oh yeah that   be fine you know that but see but that your your position be different mhm okay that   be yeah that   be true yours be in a be a much more official capacity because you be the one who answer to the board yeah right you have to do that and you be th can voice an opinion about thing yeah but the big deal where i think it be an issue th where i hear thing about it be during the annual meeting right after when we have the discussion about the poster oh when we bring up the thing be pat uh pat be right in the middle of it see i i be   not there and she be say well this be a great piece and this be this well yeah you know i do   not wan na embarrass her she should   not have do that and i do   not wan na do anything i know but i just see people kinda go that be out yeah you know yeah and that   be true she should not   have be in on that at all she should not   have be you know cause that   be not part of her capacity she   be not on that committee mhm mhm you know and if she want you know basically the thing be you know if she want to be a board person mhm that   be fine i mean let   be look into b pursuing that right right but see i   be afraid we   be gon na lose jim because of that he feel there   be a conflict and uh it   be definitely gon na happen i mean he say there   be no question about it we   have talk yeah and maybe it   be right maybe it s it be gon na be right yeah you know well he d i mean he do   not seem to you   have talk to him and i   have talk to him and well he seem to be i mean he say mayb you know after the board retreat now yeah but not well i a you know i want him i say i want you to stay through the board retreat yeah i say and the reason be because i say we need people who know i say right now we have you know four new board member or five yeah you know yeah four whatever four new board yeah and we   be at this point of say okay uh all of a sudden we have t all these you know question to answer mhm you know we have all these thing that we have to do mhm and we have this commitment of time uh and but they do   not know everything that   be go on in the last year they need to be educate as to see this no no this retreat that   be why you see i think it   be important because i mean i realize that i   would never see the bylaw since i be on the board until i ask for a copy mhm mhm right yeah now what i what i have do though be to you know any new board member that jump on i send them good copy of the because i wan na yeah i wan na get these book but ty typically they no one read em well that   be fine you know but it   be at least they   have get but i think what i wan na do be i   be gon na i wan na draft a letter mhm like i say which mhm say to them you know this be what we   be do this be the purpose of this retreat mhm to new board member and you know board member for a while it be we need to find out what it be we   be do yeah whether we   be do something right or not you know right right i think we be b but oh yeah sure we be i think sure we be the thing be i do   not i need to b them to kind of commit to to be responsible mhm yeah and uh i mean i kinda hate to feel like i   be take charge but th i guess that   be what i   be i   be need to do well yeah for you know but y y you do and you   be and that   be kind of why i   be and you   be present i   be go to assign thing unhunh you know at some point we   be gon na have committee and we   be gon na have you know mhm b people that   will be give task yeah you know specifically yeah like you know i do   not need to do all this call aro to find a r a r retreat space but i figure if i do   not do it that   be right it   be gon na fall on you or pat yeah of course yeah you know and normally that   be that   be what happen that   be okay but i mean uh you know i i   be a i   be a i   be aware of a lot of the thing that be go on you know yeah i know that you   be get ready to leave and pat   be do thing so i   would better let you go get her yeah i know okay and we   will continue this well yeah there in some manner but we do   not have to talk about it at lunch if you do   not want but i think no that   be fine if we can that   be fine if we can go ahead and carry on um at some point you and i i think yeah because one thing that come to mind be be the well the question of meeting quarterly be that enough meaning have you know the it would be enough if committee be to meet uh if committee yeah and that   be the but that that   be that be paul   be uh desire and i think be uh that   be what we wan na talk ab we   will talk about that there too and say look mhm you know be quarterly you know we would we need to meet every other month mhm you know do we need t do we need to meet you know as a full board every oth w we should   not have to we should   not if the committee uh but these committee need to be active function properly and to do their thing right basically you know the publication committee need to be more involved than just make decision on what we publish yeah you know yeah they need to become somewhat self sufficient collection committee need you know i would like to create collection committee to be something where we   be almost match yeah fund they can raise maybe unhunh yeah you know if they can raise ten grand well you know and have some i mean realistically have some incentive right for them to yeah so that basically they   would be they   would get to a point of say mhm okay we need to be responsible with this so that collection yeah and publication will be all fund raise too right oh boy phil that   be yeah it   be not gon na be pretty yeah that   be where because that   be you know also we may consider you know we have one board opening and i we may think about gail well gail be very interested and so be this we meet with another person by the name of bill ashby hm yeah i know jack and i and jim meet with him oh you mean his jack   be financial friend that jack   be friend be retire yeah he   be a banker yeah and he   would be good on one hand but yeah i would like ideally i   would want em both yeah yeah you know and i   be hope yeah i what i   be gon na what i   be anticipate do be uh this retreat might urge people to say i   be not interested in do that much work yeah and so i   be get yeah and it might just f get like nancy and kay i mean i like kay see nancy be go off she she tell me she be go off this year and she uh and kay convinced say well nancy you ca   not leave right away and uh uh she say okay i   will stay another year but i do   not know why you know and and then we can why tha i think that   be very important to discuss at the board retreat i think it be because i mean the thing be that we need to get to a point and the reason we   have set term be because basically people here mhm majority of us have be here a long time yeah that   be right you know and there   be a point well that   be why we have this the term limitation unhunh i   be i i   be uh full agreement cause i   be ready you know yeah i   have agree to do this term yeah mhm but mhm my feeling be i   be ready for a year off yeah you know mhm and i   will still be volunteer but i really be ready for some time to say mhm you know and i want jim to consider be market manager even if he go off the board yeah i know he be waver a little bit on that whether or not he would volunteer at the marketing center yeah i mean there   be i   have get ta run now okay j see you brad um but the lun uh we   be gon na meet here oh you   be gon na have x so we can d either swing by for you or we can decide we   will call you oh so you   be not when i know what we   be do if you want okay that   would be great alright talk to you in a bit sam have be have take such an interest in this retirement bit that it it really surprise me well she   be begin to listen yes she have you know she have uh she use to go over and read a book yeah or or something b turn a deaf ear that be for sure but uh once you understand it you know you you   be interested in get right in and go after it yeah i really oughta call at least reg barr and ask if uh he   be still speak to me well now he be the one that be up on the left yeah up there yeah yes well he come over to you all smile i notice nyes well we   have know each other for thirty some year why would   not he but a anyway um i be so glad that he open up on this disclosure bit because it be burn that   be be object to our have it oh and i know this so when he open up on that and she follow through and tell about her husband you know door not necessarily that she would approve of it but at least she be   not disapprove yeah of it yeah and uh course duvall might and i i can not get over this that man i really can not and you know he must have be think when he say he be   not a political appointee he must have be associate his relationship with steitler oh i really do believe that mhm in his thinking i do   not know how else he could have do it that topple over um but he do   not say that oh he say i love your hum humor uh and i love you but i be not a political appointee q and his eye be just snap and i say oh q how do you get on the board q well he say i get a letter from the governor ask

just say and there   be doctor duvall you know and then i go to rotus who   be a seasoned politician yeah if there ever be one he just would flare and i say well i alright i say i   will apologize

about have the capacity to impact public policy alright so if we   be talk about politics politic be tie into the whole concept of power right and if we   be talk about empowerment as a concept we must have an understanding of the notion of what be power now do power come in one form do it come in many different form different different form back here what form give me example of power either one of you education knowledge alright knowledge knowledge okay what else um wh money wh um your position in the workforce um okay i   be try to think of the word alright close right wealth number wealth number of people number of people right what else social status social status position right if you   be the chairperson of um a major corporation would you say that that person have some power most definitely alright especially if you   be in uh ibm or general motors or chrysler corporation and i think in some some t some example some gender and race can give you power gender race alright gender let   be deal with that alright gender race let   be talk about race in term of power if i make the statement which i do that there   be no fear factor when it come to the chicanolatino community and there be much more of a fear factor in deal with the africanamerican community be i not deal with a racial factor of power wh yes wh sure why because it   be gon na affect the decision make process the politic and um the policy alright africa in um i kinda like in past africanamerican have be more organize and have have more leader or not more leader but who have more leader who   have be know or something more recognize like martin luther king that   be right yeah more recognize and alright i think that   be a fear factor that be a part of the fear factor mhm i mean uh if one look at what uh jesse jackson be do vis a vis who the major league baseball team and all that football and all that what   be his underlie argument what   be his criticism that there   be not sufficient number of what black well he say minority he   be smart he   be talk about minority but he   be really talk about africanamerican in the uh managerial process of right of professional sport exactly managerial owner manager et cetera right alright have you hear of a latino say this or would a jesse jackson have say that about latinos hm no unhunh we have   not and uh we   be gon na get into that in our discussion alright so the whole notion of power be very important to understand because here i be make some statement alright some generality that some people would say be not true i mean how can doctor montoya say that latino have no no real power no fear factor after all they have two people that be cabinet member they have supervisor here in los angeles they have city council people in los angeles and yet he   be say that they have no power well power be relative as well right it   be relative it   be relational power be relational how can you measure power power be impossible to measure alright in other word you can not break power apart into vi various ingredient and say a b c d these be the ingredient of power we can make generality position wealth all these different thing that i   have talk about but power be difficult to measure so that we must deal with the whole question of empowerment from also the perspective of potential power versus actual power there be a difference if i be for example the president of a major labor union or a major corporation the position as president of that entity give me so much power but yet if i do not know how to utilize that entity in term of its mobilization for a give objective like a labor union if i have fourteen million people as member and i do   not show any manifestation of power be i powerful well it have to be measure by what you   be try to do what the objective be example labor today be be challenge by perhaps one of the most serious piece of not legislation per se because it   be not in a legislative form yet but a propose north american free trade agreement that if pass by congress be go to impact three economy canada us and mexico labor as a sector be go to be the most impact how be labor today mobilize its great power uh not just the aflcio and its fourteen million member but the united auto worker and many other or labor organization what be they do to influence public policy combine power huh they   be combine their power how be they combine their power by al ally with other um union of worker alright they   be they   be they   be form coalition among themselves they   be form coalition with who environmental group right cause environment supposedly be go to be also negatively impact especially along the border alright so there   be there   be a lot of coalition building but can you say as a historian that labor be do what they be infamous for do thirty forty year ago take to the street no no they   have definitely lose power alright good point they have he say they have lose power so your measurement of a loss of power be base on what what they can and ca   not alright alright you do   not see what you   have read about right right today alright that   be one perception be the black community less powerful today in nineteenninetythree than it be in nineteen sixty eight with the poor people   be march on washington or nineteensixtythree again on the w uh march uh to washington on washington when martin luther king give his famous speech i have a dream there be three hundred thousand people at that march in nineteensixtythree which period of time historically speak be a time where black be manifest much more power today or nineteensixtythree or nineteensixtyeight when when they m manifest they   be begin to get more power when uh in in comp in in now when do uh make a comparison nineteenninetythree nineteensixtyeight nineteensixtythree during those three period when would you say black demonstrate much more power now they have more power now they have more power why do you say that cause they   be more recognize i mean do recognition give you power hm yeah p to a to some aspect yeah i think i think the the problem with your question be s a different sort of power ah very good explain that you have uh you have africanamerican more institutionalize in our system now ah than they be in sixtyeight alright stop right there today they have how many congressman thirty eight thirty eight congressional representative i do   not know how many they have in nineteensixtythree i   be not even gon na try to guess but uh probably no more than two or three if they be lucky alright would you say that i would say that   be right alright go on what else in sixtyeight the black be a whole lot more mobile mobilize much better mobilize threehundredthousand march on washington be an example you probably could   not get that today okay alright cough you know with chicanos the highpoint of the mobilization capability be nineteenseventy during the era of the vietnam war twentyfivethousand chicanos be mobilize in los angeles a at the national chicano moratorium against the war no one have come even close with the exception of the death of cesar chavez recently where there be approximately fortythousand people to mobilize large number of people into some kind of a effort or movement alright so he   be correct it depend on the time depend on the circumstance and the form of power institutionalize power be different from the unconventional form that uh y you just describe alright well what we   be try to get at be potential versus actual my argument as humble as it be be that chicanos in nineteenninetythree be fast develop a high potential for power but they   be a long way from actualize their true power okay in other word they   be we   be still at the potential phase of our empowerment and not at the actual power phase alright anything else on those two concept alright let   be get into discussion on voter participation and these be kind of general comment i do   not have the time to give you a lot of statistic but i   will give you some general uh trend some statistical information that will prove a point that will introduce the subject of political participation in the united states now a democracy the participation of the citizenry be imperative it be absolutely imperative if it   be to be a democracy to have the people participate now what be i try to say what be i try to say it be imperative for the people to participate in the political process another way of say it what be i say we have to vote everyone but why be it important in a democracy for the people to participate just deal with the question not the method you mean because if the people do   not vote it will be there will be an elite group it   will be more of a monarchy that have control it wo   not be a democracy okay what   be a monarchy king one ruler well one royalty what one ruler royalty or one family alright close there   be a royal type of family right king yeah not elect alright hereditary et cetera et cetera alright but what be i get at w what   be the essence of what i   be ask for yes fire away by its very nature democracy demand vote without vote ah stop right there you make a statement by the very nature of democracy what be a democracy democracy be rule by the people alright l demos cratos l right people rule another greek word the greeks be major contributor to this political process of development of concept l demos cratos l people govern or people rule alright we tell the world that democracy be what we practice be that correct be that what we tell the world yeah yes alright would you agree with that okay what else do we say sell our political system in sell our political system we make it synonymous synonymous by say that we do   not distinguish the form of economic system versus the political system and that we put it in the same kettle democracy and capitalism be essentially the same be they the same no no but yet we do and if we listen carefully and read carefully all these book on international relation foreign relation and so forth what be it that we tell the world that america be the cradle of democracy we be the cradle of democracy we be the bastion of the free world et cetera et cetera et cetera and when ronald reagan be in power we talk about the evil empire right categorize uh the soviet union and the socalled communist empire as a evil empire alright i say this because there be a tendency for some of us to believe because we have be condition right who condition us to think the way we think what do we deci what do we say earlier talk about culture um they learn through school through their family school right school the medium everything else i mean do   not the medium tell us that there   be only a twoparty system in this country mhm mhm why be it that the communist party the socialist workers party the prohibitionist party the american independent party all these party that we have supposedly minority party do   not get the same kind of treatment as the democratic and republican party they   be not mainstream right we have a two party system we be teach from the very beginning that there   be only two party that   be a l different subject but i   be what i   be the point i   be try to make be that if we look into the reality of what we have as a political system we tell the world that in this country democracy be very much alive because we have a congress we have a supreme court we have a presidency we have a political system that be govern by certain principle and law that emanate from what the constitution which be a live document the constitution right that be very much the document that protect conceptually and otherwise our way of life our democracy and so forth well if we remember our chicano history my point as we get into the whole question of chicano political participation be that it   be difficult for us as chicanos as we get into it to understand why be it include ourselves because a lot of chicanos do   not even understand why we do   not vote why do   not we participate and they come up with all kind of somewhat superficial analysis that much of our political behavior be a product of what be cover in this class under history and culture and what do i say two major current of history two major current of political culture right and what be political culture i   will get back to that concept but just general term what be political culture what be political culture alright i want you to think put that concept down because you   be gon na you   be gon na hear about it in the next few minute it   be very important that you understand that concept political culture but i want thing i want to underline here be that we be product of a historical dualistic process mexico   be history us history we   be a pr we   be product of what a cultural process that   be also mexican and american whatever american mean alright so those two major ingredient have mold the rationale that i   be use in this class to explain why be it that we   be still at the potential phase of empowerment and we still have a long way to go before we realize that concept that i describe call empowerment but before we get into that s substance of that be that i wan na just briefly cover that even though i   be say that chicanos do not vote in great number and we do   not participate in many organization in great number the fact be as i mention earlier that even though we tell the world we be this beacon of light of freedom of liberty justice and all these different thing by and large not a lot of people participate politically across the board i do   not care if you   be african american i do   not care if you   be asian american and i do   not care if you   be latino or whatever most americans do not vote in great number so it   be a double whammy introduce the subject matter here americans in comparison to great britain in comparison to france in comparison to germany in comparison to italy we do   not vote in the number that they do alright i mean if we have more time i could give you statistic after statistic italy for example have a voter turnout of ninety percent of those that be eligible to vote we   be lucky if we get fifty percent be we less democratic be they more democratic why be it that italy have a much large a high voter level of participation or germany or even canada seventy percent the fact be that democracy in this country be die i want you to put that down cause it   be gon na be important at least for my analysis i do   not want you to agree or disagree at this point just write it down you have plenty of time one week to think about it american democracy be die i want you to put that whole phrase in black and white american democracy be die and i want you to try to think of why as we get into the discussion of chicano participation and we   will get back to that statement next week so for us as chicano it   be a double jeopardy that   be another point i wan na underscore because if the large general population do   not vote in great number when you   be at the bottom of a political socioeconomic totem pole and you   be at the bottom you   be at the very bottom with all the problem of poverty and all the social problem that we   be we   have be talk about it   be understandable why perhaps chicano do not vote or participate in great number now the literature in political science deal with factor influence influence voting be many be many civic culture almond and verba nineteen seventy two or so be one book that you can look at um there   be a book by raymond wolfinger steven ronsteen ronstone i   be sorry who vote that   be another book okay the literature go on and on but all i want to do in term of just give you some idea of what be the factor that influence people ' participation in the political process of this country and there be essentially five you can probably develop more but these be general category most of the literature in political science and i think mister verba would agree with me on this that people tend to vote because they have a sense of duty what do that mean a sense of duty they regard participation as important now why would you say that this be a factor that influence vote now this be a very somewhat altruistic uh value right a sense of duty why why would you say that people in this country have a some people that vote cough cough vote because they have a sense of duty why right here i do   not know probably it stem mostly from your education your childhood when your tell you   be an american citizen and it   be your civic duty you know towards other people and you know get the government go to vote and put your two cent in because without you then y we wo   not have government same sense of jury duty too jury okay good point duty as we go through some of these these five i want you to think of the agent of socialization because then i want you to think when we get into the discussion on chicanos how do those agent affect us as chicanos alright number one sense of duty who be responsible for inculcate that sense of duty one the family alright remember the family be your primary agent two the educational institution i mean from the time that you start kindergarten to the time that you graduate from the university it   be constant not constant but somewhat of a consistent bombardment of value attitudes et cetera reinforce the nature of the political system and the virtue of participate in the political process so in essence what i   be say be you acquire this through the socialization process that we   have discuss already yes i think that it   be more eye opening to see that this do   not exist more than it do and that   be why people do   not vote it seem that i mean you talk to people they have an attitude i ca   not make a difference that   be why i do   not vote it   be not my responsibility that   be why i do   not vote there   be not a sense of duty even though like you say from the beginning supposedly we   be get it all through school why do you suppose that have change and this be a much of a recent phenomena much more because you   have have decline voter participation level since the nineteen seventy and i   be give you the answer wa what what what have be the problem contribute to what you just say well i agree i agree with what he be say but i think m maybe one of the reason could be they   be not be represent they do   not think they   be be represent they do   not um see any like direct result for them you know come out of like mhm the representation the government and who   be in control okay i think i i n that   be you know there be a lot of people sure alright i mean that   be would you agree with that a lot of people mhm they vote their pocketbook sure they they   be they vote their pocketbook p they vote definitely their pocketbook alright that   be true what would you add to f well you say we   be not represent it   be like we say there   be not much choice between say like the last um you know you vote for clinton or you know you know whatever his name be bush yeah bush in a bush no i do   not think the other guy i do   not think there   be as much trust oh perot trust trust in the system why a lot more corruption i mean you have nixon why to watergate what do you have in the seventy now l let   be talk about that what what do what do what do we have okay you well in the beginning well even in the late sixty you have vietnam you have uh good excellent what do vietnam do turn uh the youth especially against the government policie the educated youth more so and those be i think the people that be gon na be vote as they go on they lose faith in the system they lose faith in their leader alright alright on that score would you say that most of you without get personal here be product uh in term of birth of the sixty all of you be bear in the sixty early seventy right so that mean that most of your parent be very much a part of the era of the sixty right alright would you say go back to you that your parent be very much influence by the vietnam war one way or the other yeah which which way which direction um total apathy total apathy yeah why um well my mom total apathy uh she just i th i do   not know i think she just get burn out she get sick and tired of you know turn on the news and see another corrupt man or another you know another scandal break out she know friend that be die in viet you know she have friend that be draft be send be die and she do   not you know she do   not believe in the system and she just do   not care anymore i think it be just a lot of negative have build up okay and she just let it go okay how about you how about your parent um well my dad be draft he be in vietnam um long story he do   not make it to vietnam but um but he be in the military during that time he be in the military at the time alright yeah okay my mom claim she be too young to know but i do   not know okay um i do   not know how my dad really feel about it i know we come from a long line of military man so he kind of feel a sense of duty so um be there a sense of betrayal possibly yeah mhm okay who else who want who else want to share something here about what we   be try to say be that just carbonate water no thank you no no this be cream soda it   be cream soda oh boy the good it   be the good

home device fleck up gross fleck up what do you say kendie gross gross gross she say gross well well anyway okay one large loan renew a hundred ninety seven thousand a hundred eighty dollar it   be on gerald and pamela okay they   have pay they   have reduce no problem he   be handle his line of credit as agree so it   be pretty routine joe okay p first loan request i have be an exist real estate mortgage that will be refinance into the secondary market of fannie mae customer be gerry and pamela tucker at sixty one fifty eight main street in hillsdale illinois they   be request eighty four thousand dollar on a thirty year fannie mae fix rate loan this would include the cost of do the refinance appraisal title work and point eighty four eighty four even their monthly payment of principle interest taxis and insurance would be seven sixty one eighty nine base at the current thirty year rate they estimate the value of their home to be one hundred and ten thousand dollar we have an appraisal in nineteen ninety one by a certify appraiser that indicate the value of the house be a hundred and three thousand dollar eighty percent of that would make it eighty two four so um in order to make them a loan for eighty four thousand it must appraise for a hundred and five so that will be will determine whether or not we can go the full eighty four and whether they have to come up with some money out of pocket their asset total one sixteen four seventeen their liability eighty three their net worth thirty one so all they owe be the house mhm they um t t t currently have a debt to income of twenty eight over twenty seven and after the refinance they would have a debt to income of fifteen over twenty three where be they now i miss that they   be fifteen over no they   be currently twenty they ca   not be over twenty seven i oh okay twenty yeah twenty over twenty seven yeah you ca   not even twenty over tw you ca   not even read your writing i could   not even read my f my own writing it   be twenty over twenty seven okay and after the refi it   be fifteen over twenty three what be acceptable pretty much uh what figure twenty eight over thirty six be the max it   be as high as it could go see so they   be well within okay i just wonder they   be well within their debt to income i always hear the figure and never do know what be high and right low do   not make any difference yeah um so you say they   be gon na be fifteen mhm fifteen over twenty three so their debt to income be   not a problem the uh problem as i see it be the value of the house number one and the second matter at hand be that in nineteen eighty seven they have file a chapter eleven they have at the time a mortgage with us they reaffirm on that mortgage they be never late we uh after that discharge we even advance them money to purchase this house on main st street here in hillsdale and um they have never miss a payment on that loan i   have also make them car loan that they   have never miss a payment on and um accord to fannie mae guideline as long as they have be discharge at least two year and reestablish and pay as agree their credit obligation they would qualify for a fannie mae mortgage with that in mind um i be move that they app uh that we approve this loan request subject to a uh certify appraisal of their home do we have the discharge yes i have a copy of it mhm when be it it be discharge on november uh no two twenty three eighty eight discharge date be two twenty three of eighty eight when do they file do   not you say they file in eighty seven eleven of eighty seven in eleven mhm three month whew that   be pretty fast yeah what do they do dismiss it it be a business no it be a business uh bankruptcy and it be pretty cut and dry they just be eliminate the business um debt and apparently nobody object to the the bankruptcy since they reaffirm with their secured creditor all the debt that be charge that be bank file bankruptcy against be unsecured creditor and they discharge em before they even perform or anything yeah in a three mon i guess so in a p three month period of time cause here   be the no i i just it   be unusual that they do   not require em to you know usually they put em on a two year or three year plan or something mhm see the from what i i gather be the unsecured creditor get nothing and the secure creditor just carry on their payment history as agree as originally set forth in their contract but you know usually the plan   will provide some period of time of protection oh i yeah mhm but if we   have get uh for those unsecured creditor yeah but if we   have get the discharge yeah okay well in that case that   be hard to believe because it say that notice of joint discharge of joint debtor it it appear the person name above file a petition commence yeah joint case under title eleven mhm on november twenty third of nineteen eighty seven and that an order of relief have be enter no complaint object to the discharge of the debtor be file within the time fix by the court yeah yeah uh what be that ten minute or yeah and um yeah see i do   not know how they get it do that fast and and that they   be um hell we ca   not even get to court in three month i know hm that   be ridiculous that i have a lean and it   be date february twenty third nineteen eighty eight mhm okay that   be uh i mean three month that   be all i just yeah that   be what i be just i assume it would   have be like eighty uh ninety two or something mhm you know yeah what the five what actually happen to them be she open a franchise and it be a franchise of do packaging send m uh from a mall basis unhunh uh packaging gift wrapping and shipping shipping it cough cough well what happen cough they should have get into the business hindsight   be twenty twenty they should   have get into the business in let   be say august and then they would   have have a christmas season there be a t it get to be real complicated and they do   not get in until february well february they have nothing to do and and i think they yeah they hang in there for a year and a half and they just could   not could   not see end to it february nobody   be ship anything i   will s i   will second then joe okay so it   be move and second to uh approve that loan subject to the uh appraisal by a certify appraisal and the max be eighty four mhm okay okay all in favor aye aye aye aye oppose same sign motion carry sigh be that the only one that   be the only loan i have okay i get one small one the only reason it   be in here be because the borrower already have three hundred three thousand borrow so it have to be approve by the board but if we if jim and kurt approve it today that   would be two and then i   will have to call two more uh they wan na borrow forty f well dave want to borrow forty five hundred dollar to finish pay off the renovation and upgrade necessary on the daycare and he have initially think what he borrow would do it and then he borrow some money from his uncle and he want to repay his uncle and get that out of the way he want to set it up on a year uh it would be secure via three vehicle um you know his debt to income be relatively high but his income   be go up the daycare be schedule to open a week after the fifth so around the twelfth to fifteenth of january he think he   be be he think he be already open and then they come back in and tell him he could   not open cause there be article in the paper and they show kid at the daycare and he have his ad out and everything but he do   not have all the i   be dot and t   be cross and state come back in and say well no you ca   not really do that so one group of state people the people that do all the do the testing for electrical and safety and stuff have be there and now the state inspector   be get to come in i guess they just look at the quality of the facility not necessarily the wiring plumbing and heating but be it clean and be it safe and that sort of thing they   be suppose to be there the fifth and he say that the lady tell him that it usually take a week for them to send a report in and for their license to come back so he anticipate that they   will be open no later than the twelfth to fifteenth he give me some number i ca   not remember they   have get like thirteen or fourteen kid they   be already take care of mostly out of their house until they can get em move down there and then they   have get eight or nine more so they fully expect income to exceed the projection but right now they do   not have any income other than from his job so uh that   be fairly large scale what and he   be gon na have twenty five people the building be or something yeah at l east twenty five child yeah twenty five see they   be e yeah they   be expect that many fairly quickly and then he hope to get up around fifty see they   be look at four people plus i   have go through the building you know plus his wife and it be uh a r very very nicely do operation i mean there   be nothing shoddy about the workmanship or the quality of the material or the cleanliness of the of the building be it attach onto a storage facility no it   be a separate building oh it   be free stand building yeah separate building see it   be a they it   be a building his dad have where he be where he have his his cabinet shop okay shop and okay and be live in it and they convert the live quarter and all that into this thing it   be like anything when you   be deal with th you know regulator and the state they you know he say they get two lady for nine county and they there   be a lot of this go on and they can only get to so many so i would move since it   be secure for forty five hundred it   be on a twelve month repayment which be relatively short i would move that we advance the fund i   will second it except they owe pretty much do   not they three hundred three thousand and some odd dollar but he   be always service i mean he   be never be late he   be always pay as agree uh and they do have the income it just right now the income do   not well i say they have it once the daycare get up to twenty people they   will have enough income to mhm they   will fall back under the forty percent but right now they   be over the forty because we st ca   not show any income from the daycare um but you know it it you know i feel comfortable that it   be there and like i say he   be always service debt as agree and and his overall debt be work down it   be just quite a bit of debt you just i guess you ca   not say too much if they   be pay on time uh uh yeah and and i think they   be about to the point as long as everything work out good yeah i think if th you know th th he   be already talk if this thing go like they think it be next fall he   be want to start look at expand that storage facility it   be one of those thing i think there   be they   be always gon na have quite a bit of debt so long as cash flow   will keep up with it cause you know he   be that   be kind of their you know he   be look at that as his retirement income and an investment and this whole bit you know like some of the people do here well it   be be move and second um to approve but that we ca   not really disburse on that that due to his size of the loan until we have all they need f f all the board member majority of board member yeah four uh f at least two more board member because i   be vote yeah all in i   be vote in favor of it in favor and yeah see i be since you second it i assume so be you yeah yeah so see i   have get two and then i   will try to i   will get hold of two more i be gon na see wilbur but he do   not s dave do   not get in here until after he be go so that   be the only one i have any other loan no other loan to be discuss i get a couple thing here but uh we   will um the one be in regard to the retail nondeposit investment just to kind of bring us up to speed m matt have tentatively accept our offer for employment but since he   be go to be a dual employee th you really do   not need to put this in the minute hm okay i   will i   will c i   will catch up the board up to speed i just want us to know because it have some loan relevance uh he be interview by lcl larry harb interview him over the telephone yesterday and larry call me this morning that   be who have call about seven thirty and say everything go fine um what what we have set up be matt   be go up to chicago at lcl   be office on uh for monday evening tuesday and wednesday train the f the monday evening and tuesday training will be very specific for him their workflow their form he   will get to meet these people on wednesday then he   will be in a little bit of a large group there may be four or five other asset manager with him discuss sail motivation and and and sale approach and strategy larry say ph he do   not know how matt   be gon na plug into us philosophically and how well he   be know in the area he say that   be our decision of which i you know i   be comfortable with i want larry to tell me how he think he   be gon na do plug into the selling and he say oh you he should be he should do very well so i i   be um tho that look good what i do kind of in regard to that be and i do   not have this date finalize but s i   be try to go maybe the second week of january to have a representative of banker system come thumhere thump to do some specialized training within the qualified retirement plan area matt need matt need an understanding of not a detailed understanding but how all these qualified plan work so that he w can have so he understand how his product plug into the to the self direct iras sep and the like we also it would do us good to know what product we can offer under those qualified retirement plan so uh r ray galino i i believe be his name be suppose to come down i have   not set up a date but he   will be here on a f for a day and i want him to talk with matt vivian myself and sometime during the day to the two of you because as loan officer you have a good handle on borrower and and can kind of tell them of these sep and some of the other product uh we   have kind of hesitate in in offer those well we have not offer the self direct hm offer the self direct we   be get be simply we need to get a dif fifty different form instead of call an ira it   be call an ira sd for self direct and then that will allow people to if they do   not want all their fund in a bank cd as as be custodial ira arrangement see the exist ira say all those fund have to be in first national bank of hillsdale the self direct the the participant sign a an investment direction or where where he direct the investment they sign the form and then you invest in whatever they want to yeah uh the what how that work like with the sep the se have a vehicle have to be connect to the ira so we take the seoff the shelf and then if the person want that money put into a bank cd then we just use our custodial ira form if they want a self direct i sep you take the same seform off but you   be use a different ira you   be not use the custodial ira arrangement oh okay an semust have an ira attach to it so that so the ira all fit in the same plan they   be just different ch box check off of this overall plan and that the overall plan be what you   be talk about go back that   be what the irs have bless right they be the framework and so long as you stay within the framework in some combination you   be okay exactly so i i have talk with with rick uh brady today and he   be gon na send me those form so we can take a look at em the other the thing which make it a little more complicated but it   be really not a cost it   be kind of a s flip flop in that he recommend we do   not try and do the account maintenance on those self direct ira ourselves because of how complicated the law be in all this mhm so mhm i mean coincidentally banker system offer a comprehensive account maintainance service you   be kid be   not that well be   not that a surprise that that   be such a surprise yeah and what what what we would do be they would take care of the account maintainance in a similar manner if you will as they take care of the the other qualified plan mhm we they we send them the information th but they print it and they they crank out the number qualify it and and and they file whatever need to be file disclose it mhm the it   be really not gon na cost us it it   be gon na be pretty much of a swap right now we use their eight hundred number and their uh fi their newsletter for the ira we do   not have their comprehensive service we have their ira service and that run about three hundred dollar a year if you go to the comprehensive account maintenance the eight hundred number be include and the f and the newsletter be include so we would drop three hundred dollar off the account maintenance comprehensive account maintenance maintenance would cost us five hundred dollar but what you do be they he estimate it   would be five hundred dollar for a minimal number of account banker system charge thirty five dollar an account and he say under a self direct arrangement he   be see charge to maintain a self direct ira anywhere from forty to a hundred fifty dollar now i think a hundred fifty dollar be a lot to maintain a self direct ira mhm so you mean that you we could pass that back to the customer that   be what you   be say right right we they charge us five hundred plus thirty five per account well he he think he   be gon na send me down the information you know how the typical salesman they they they d talk in kind of nebulous term yeah but he think okay w they they have a minimum number of account oh with w be cover if you will by the five hundred yes okay and so he say way i understand it would let   be say five hundred would would cover the eight hundred which be very very helpful service mhm and uh the maintenance for let   be say twenty account well if we have ten account okay we would charge five hundred fifty dollar on ac on an account it would be five hundred dollar it   be really kind of a switch around but what what that would i think it would be good for the five or six of us to to have galino down here can kind of explain what product we can offer from the bank side hm matt need to know that and and we all need to know that and then we can figure out how matt   be the product that lcl   be gon na offer will plug into that and it   be i be think of send matt up there for a week but you know he   be up there a week he   be gon na learn a lot of very technical information such as like those section four fifteen se that that i be talk about you really do   not need to know the the technical nitty gritty about it because that   be what banker system do they take care of the nitty gritty hm so it   be gon na be less expensive to have galino come here instead of one person go up to to minnesota for a week and then try to bring back the information we   be gon na have galino come down here for a day and he wo   not he wo   not touch any specific complicated item such as four fifteen se or or actesting or that cause vivian and i kind of know that but if we do   not know that like that four fifteen uh s mhm i call the eight hundred number and and they go through the explanation where the irs change the the deduction just a just a question from a mechanic who   be gon na hold the account be lcl gon na hold the account be the bank gon na ho hold the account who act you know you   be talk about bank product and and lcl product like before the trust department if you will hold the account that that   be physically where it be mhm you know be be it   be i be the plan gon na be in the bank or will the plan be in lcl or be the plan just kind of nebulous well well the the seand the ira will will be first national bank of hillsdale okay that   be what i mean but but tho those they   be bank product if you will we offer those and then lcl if will have within that plan they   will have thing you can buy if you want to direct it that way if you do   not want a cd tha the or if you want something else you could direct that that the monie be use to buy some mutual fund or some bond fund or something right and how i envision that then okay we would get the statement from lcl for the mutual fund holding let   be say the person also have a cd okay mhm let   be you know it do   not matter how they split it like we do now and then then what what we would have to do be pull that information together we would get lcl   be statement as of the end of the year what the income be and what the balance be we would then have to if they have a cd pull that in we would report that up to banker system okay and they would then combine that and produce the report it that   be why there   be normally a cost in those self direct because it   be not with our cd now that information that   be the whole account and whatever   be out there on the on the retire on the rarecord just pass right up and and the cd and the rainformation r retirement account processing system talk together mhm when you get another vendor in here like lcl we physically have to put the paper together but it   be not that complicated but the name of his office be gon na be lcl s it   be not gon na be first national bank right right anything the the i get a f oh yeah i love expansion of business it take me forty five minute to get a phone number the phone number by the way be for lcl yeah five five five five five five five be what the phone number will be but this be thing that i   be i   be anxious for matt to get here because i   be get i   be get tucker out try to get all these nitty gritty thing it   be not tough to get the phone number but see they need the phone number in order to order letterhead mhm in order to or have business card lcl in in chicago need that mhm to get that process go hm uh uh be there lcl account gon na be maintain here cause cause actually i mean or be there gon na be a separate they   be gon na have an account in chicago for the fund to pass through or be it gon na be passthrough fund here at the bank or be that well w what we   will do be those   will probably wire transfer out through boltman or something well through the fed what i think what will happen but we matt   will find this out and i mean we   will get involve in it and i   be i   be not whichever way it go be fine but probably the most sophisticated way will be everyone who make who buy a fund or whatever that money will go into a a clear account here and then we will either lcl will will ach it out of us or we   will physically wire it up there you know there may be a hundred thousand dollar in there which may represent three people   be or four people   be purchase mhm and then matt fax the paperwork up to lcl and they do the suitability testing and then they know what product have be buy and then on the other side we do a wire transfer to physically get the money up there i think that   be how it   be gon na work si similar to fannie mae ex ex uh yes mhm sa same same same type of thing yeah we we we collect monie custodial account we collect monie and put it in account and then we tell them how much of it be theirs and by call up there and that dial deal and then it they zap it the next day yeah i do   not know if okay like that   be the same way that uh american express with the traveler   be check work when we sell traveler   be check we put that money in a clear account and then jo anne or grace or tom or somebody call whosever do that job call a number mhm and we report how much in sale we have and they d they d hit the account the next day and take the money out but that   be that   be kind of the the mechanic of the of the flow of fund but to answer your question joe be that lcl that office will not say first national bank of hillsdale or anything of the nature anywhere yeah uh the his his card will be lcl investment at first national bank of hillsdale um letterhead will be lcl there need to be a separate phone line go to that office and we   will we   will be able when we get this receptionist set up the receptionist will also answer it but when they pick up the phone you know we   will put it on a red line or blue line or something like that when they pick up that line like we do with with with bill   be number you know they they pick up and they   will say lcl investment and it   be also requirement by uh uh i guess nasdaor whomever and the comptroller that they do   not want us when that line ring we   be not gon na pick it up and go hello first national bank of hillsdale and they go oh yeah i want to talk about a mutual fund oh i   be sorry yeah you do have lcl in investment q i mean these be some of the nitty gritty thing yeah they they talk about in the regulation and i   be pretty confident they   will they   will implement those out but be matt gon na carry on his other livelihood that he have before through that office or be he totally out of the insurance business n he be meet with they have a regional meeting or meeting with their regional manager today and he be go to to tell him that he   be plan to take a job here c common courtesy say that he need to give em two week notice but the the practice within the the industry and larry matt say this and also larry harb say this so i know it   be not matt   be employer it   be just within that industry as soon as a person say i   have decide to move on to another another uh uh customer or an another employer doorknocke ni come in dooropen do you need to talk to genevieve n i   will g see if she   be gon na be at a number where i could talk to her in maybe a half an hour or forty five minute okay or else i   will give her a call tomorrow okay um doorclose as soon as they get notice they typically say well fine thank for the two week notice but it   be effective today and then they electronically transfer his license to his to to lcl joannebut so these slide should be real interesting ken yeah i think it   will be real interesting i think it   will be a real a good slide show too bad you ca   not make it lenore who else do you know that   be be there besides what   be her name ken just jessie and shana joanne shana her kenthat   be all yeah shana   be sort of joanne i wan na go but ken i   would like to go also joanne it   be an interesting thing kenbut joanne hunh ken i   would like to go joanne it   be an interesting thing though because um i   be wonder you know since it be such m it   be restrict you have to go through mexico ken no i do   not think so joanne be   not nicaragua one of the thing you kenno joanneplace you ca   not go keni do   not think so no joannei think it be kenwe have no i do   not think so we have f f technically speak full diplomatic relation with nicaragua joanne oh yeah kenyeah they have an an ambassador and you know an american ambassador there joanne i then why do everybody always have to go through mexico kenwho like a nest of cia spy that   be just there there be   not a direct transportation but there n joannei think kenit   be not joanneno but i think it w ken it   be not like go to cuba where they have to make connection through mexico because joanne oh i know someone who go to cuba ken joanneand have to go kenyeah joannemake connection through mexico ken that   be because it   be illegal for americans to travel to cuba joanne but i wonder whether this it be kenyeah it be joanneoh yeah just like lebanon just become lenore how long joanne they say lebanon be actually lenorehow long   be joannethey it d just become illegal and and i you know ken for a few year lenore how long have it be illegal joanne libya too be   not libya as well there   be quite a few pla libya ken there   be only a there   be only a handful of place lenorehow long have it be illegal for americans to ken lenorego to cuba kenwell joannesince the fif kenit be illegal joannesince the fifty kenit be illegal joanneor the sixty kenit be illegal you know from like the time of cath the castro revolution up until i think the early seventy the supreme court overturn travel restriction on the um on the passport and say that the government could   not really permit you from go anywh uh prevent you from go anywhere and then tha joanne kenthat change again a few year later they pass some law or something like that which do enable the government to to do um visa res restriction and i think cuba and north korea joanne now lebanon ken and now lebanon and libya joanne unhunh ken be the only place that uh maybe north maybe vietnam also joanne kenwhere you joanne ken you   be supposedly not able to use your passport to go to but you really i mean you can joanne they know ken you know joanne the thing be what i   be wonder kenyou can like people go to cuba all the time joannewhat i   be wonder be people that go to nicara ken and less o less often to nicar joanne do   not the state department kento north to vietnam and north korea joanne would   not the state department know everybody that go to nicaragua kenbut people go to cuba all the time psure joannewould   not they know and that   be what   be sort of worrisome ken be b crawl with the cia joanne that   be what   be worri worrisome but that i   be sure if they i   be sure they have jessie on a list anyway but kenoh yeah joannei mean but i   be say well he   be the only exist live member of the peace and freedom party leave ken joanneyou know but but he   be a ken the only one under the age of sixty joanneyeah i know and it   be really funny ken joannethat i would think that they would have a a thing on you they would actually possibly even keep an eye on you or or watch you i do   not know how many americans have be to nicaragua ken oh i doubt it joannehow many ken no plenty joanne kenthere   be de there   be delegation that lenorea lot have go that   be true a lot of people ken a lot of del there   be delegation go every week lenore

  not let me see it ken i   be not lenore kenit just i mean the idea of drop a little goldfish into there lenore kenand then like you know watch it like go like joanneit   be neat kenyou know like pick goop off the bottom and do its little goldfish business you know and then all of a sudden have a turtle come over joanne kenand take a big hunk out of it you know and then that get a little shock joannethey wo   not eat it the thing be it kenyou know joannethe thing it uh will actually be half swimming and half not ken h joanneand they take bite out of it kenwell you know they take bite joannethey d it   be not a whole thing kenyou know and and sometimes they can get the whole thing down at once other time they just like eat the tail joanne they do   not quite make it kenand a piece of the fin and and then the you know the goldfish manage to get away and flutter around the tank try to get away from him joanne h kenha half go joanneoh ken ken i do   not have the heart for that kind of thing joanne when you say it that way i do   not think i could stand it eith well you know what i be do be for about two month when i have that snake in my classroom i would once a week it would be a whole ritual tuesday the kid know tuesday we would all sit around the rug we   would put the snake we we name it sissy and we   would put we   would s put sissy like right in front of all the kid and i would get buy a feeder locally and i would bring it in and i would put it in the little thing and we would watch the snake hunt you know we would watch sissy hunt the goldfish and the go and the snake and t be so h ken lenore your snake be eat goldfish joanne yeah ken mhm joanne it would l eat only live thing th that   be the only way they feed you have to buy em feed fish ken yeah they wo   not eat some k joanne kensome kind of snake wo   not eat joanne they   will eat cricket ken eat dead thing joanneand thing like that lenore oh yeah so you put little goldfish down in the box joanne i would put it lenoreand then it would ken but they   would put it in a little joanneno no in a bowl kenin like a little cup a little water joanneand cause it   will only eat it live and so the snake the bowl be about yea big you know and then the snake would start to it would see it and it would start to do this whole little dance it would start circle the bowl and wrap itself and it would get fast and faster then it would start s it would start move at the same pace that the snake would b that the fish would be swim and it would start kinda follow it and go fast and fast it would be like this little whirlwind you know and all of a sudden it would go chk and you know what   be so funny the snake be v th they   be v they   be very b th i guess they   be very bright about goldfish cause it ken joanneit would rarely get it it would rarely get the fish it w by the fin it would almost always get it by the head because it be streamline cause it would it it would get it by the tail then the fin would all get it would be hard to swallow do you know what i mean lenore mhm joanneit would get all fluff out lenore right joanne and um the kid love it ken well joanneit be their favorite time of the week they lo and except ken blood thirsty little bastard joanne i have one little girl i have one little girl name ana mehia ken hiccup joanne and she be this sensitive sweet little girl from uh guatemala who be actually her language be great and every time you know what she would do the first time she do she she do she cross herself she do the cross for the fish ken for the fish joanne and i ask her why do you do that ken little fishy joanneand she go so that the fish   will go to heaven ken aw be   not that sweet joanne and then from that point and then she cry and then from that point on everybody would be sit there look at the fish anxiously and i would have to tell em to sit down cause you know other ca   not see ken calm down joannecalm down ken joanne she would turn around so she   would be face the wall so she could   not watch ken well a very sensitive little kid joanne this seven year old kid and she would   not wa and she be t be like talk about you know i not influence by peer pressure cause all the kid be excite and and she know in a sense that she be s kinda suppose to be excite cause all of the other kid and she no she be and it   be really really really interesting you know lenore i wonder what her personal history joanne and and then we ken yeah oh joanneyou know we draw keni know joanne what be so funny be you know we have like language lesson from it ken joannewe write about it you know and they would do one or two sentence about it and a lot of the kid mention ana and y the snake sissy s eat the fish and ana cry lenore joanne that be like their ken joannea lot of them do those sentence lenore great joanneand it be really fu and then a lot of them would draw a picture of ana you know they   would they   would do their sentence and then they   would draw a picture of ana um cry lenore and what do she write joanne um lenore sissy eat the fish and i cry joanne i lenore ken joanneki i do   not remember what she write but it be something similar like that it be something like the f the eat the goldfish and stuff and i would   not you know i   would i would have it from the morning cause i would pick it up in the morning or i   would pick it up the n that   be what i   would do i   would pick it up the night before like if it w if we   be feed it i would pick it up monday i would take it home and that be the bad part i would take it home and i would like put it in i would leave it in its plastic bag put it in a bunch of water in the sink and i would   not go near the sink cause i do   not wan na look at this thing i do   not wan na get friendly with this fish you know and then i would take it in i would t put it in its bag and i would put it in a paper bag and so i would   not look at it and i would put it like over by the sink in the classroom all day you know until it be feed time and i would   not look at it and i would   not let the kid look at it only when it be put into the bowl cause i just it be i be the bad lenoreyou do   not wan na get joannei be go ew ew q you know like th ken listen to her joanneit be really ken f you know five minute ago she say she really wouldlove to see the turtle eat a goldfish joanne kennow she   be say how it be the bad joanne no no no but lenore ken lenore joanne it be just the idea of it ken joanneit   be interesting it   be neat ken yeah it   be interesting but joanneyou know to see it but but but to actually see it lenore ken joanneis be not as uh ken i remember once joanne kenwhen i be a kid it rit   be really stick in my mind joanne h kenh i go joanne keni use to l um go to an elementary school that have like a p a pet shop right around the corner from it and i use to go into the pet store and look at all the b the animal joanne do   not you guy go to the same elementary school kenand the fish and stuff all the time los feliz anyway um lenore where be y el where be the pet kenright around the corner where thyou know where the bank be the security bank and there   be all those little shop joanne unhunh kenthere   be like tamara   be that sandwich shop joanne kenand stuff lenoreon hollywood ken um joanne kenhunh joanneno on vermont lenoreon hol ken it be on vermont on vermont like w maybe six shop up from from uh um hollywood or prospect rather um there be a little pet shop call pandora   be pets joanne kenwhen i be in elementary school joanne wh pandor   be pet wh kenanyway i remember they have a they have this fish in there call an oscar and they be these like they be these really joanne i remember yeah th they   be big ken they   be these big gnarly sucker they   be like um joanne yeah i remember what they look like ken they   be like m f i do   not know six or eight inch joannebig eye ken and they   have get they only eat like other fish they eat like small fish joanne kenand they eat like you know like goldfish and i guess goldfish or guppy get the brunt of everything poor guy they   be like the you know they   be like the cattle of the animal world they   be breed only to feed other thing joanneyeah feeds yeah they   be feeder ken anyway anyway so joannethey   be nothing but tank of feeder in every pet shop ken i remember w watch them feed the oscar once when i be a kid and they drop in the goldfish and i do   not think i   would ever see it before maybe i do i do   not remember but this time particularly stick in my mind he drop the goldfish into the tank and the goldfish go and sw swim around mind his own little business eat glop and all that shit you know that fish do and the oscar sneak up behind it and open its mouth and like create a vacuum kinda thing cause joanne oh my god ken you get this huge mouth that suck the goldfish in joanne oh my god right from the water ken yeah and and then joanneand it do   not even kenand then uh but the goldfish get stick half way into his mouth joanne it go the wrong way kenno it be go joanne fin first kenit be go joanne mouth first ken well it be go it go tail first joannethat   be the problem ken i guess that   be the wrong way joanne that   be the problem keni do   not know anyway joanne ken so you get this oscar there swim around in the tank joanne i learn a lot from that snake ken with like joanne ken a goldfish joanne kensticke out of his mouth you know the the head of a goldfish so you could see the little goldfish   be eye and his little mouth go gbloop bloop bloop bloop and the oscar   be there swim around and you could tell the little goldfish i mean they do   not have what you would call massively expressive face lenore ken but i think it be worry you know it g it   be go bloop bloop bloop bloop and it   be get these like wide open eye you know lenore ken i be just imagine what be go through its little mind lenore kena the oscar be swim around frantically try to dislodge it so it could swallow it lenore kenyou know and um finally it d do manage to you know v like loosen it lenore spit it out ken i do   not know remember if it spit it out or lenore cack it up ken or what but it manage to like you know lenore dislodge it joanne mhm ken dislodge it one way and then swallow it tammy well um i want to say i   be really happy with the stuff i get now brad good good tammy and i   be really basically i   be back for a tape deck brad oh okay tammy so um one of my thought be that um well i want a tape deck that   be gon na sound about you know as good as it can bradokay tammyand i think i want a tape deck with two place for two tape so i can copy brad okay tammy but i   have never do this before i do   not know much about tape i mean i h bradokay tammy i have a boombox you know ordinary sort of thing brad sure tammy so i wonder if you would suggest that this luxman be the be w one of the thing you   would want me to think about brad um the uh would you you would want the the ability uh of the double cassette deck just purely for tape from one tape to the other that   be its main purpose in fact i would   not know what other purpose it would have bradoh okay the other benefit be be if you can load up two tape in it like let   be say two ninety minute tape of music tammy unhunh i see brad and you can set a switch on it tammy i see brad where it will continually play tammy okay okay brad all four side of two tape tammyi see that   be probably not gon na happen brad okay tammyno it   be mainly for copy brad okay tammy so brad and the tape you   would be copy uh be they gon na be straight music tammy mmostly brad okay tammyyeah brad okay tammyyeah bradso you be gon na want or desire a pretty decent uh copy of your original tape tammy mhm right brad okay um tammy and the original will be from music lover you know who probably have pretty good system not brad okay tammyi   be we   be not talk stratosphere brad sure tammy but p bradsure tammy anyway bradokay tammy brad um because on a um a tape deck like that you realize that you   be not gon na be able to get a copy that   be you know tammy mhm brad as perfect as tammy mhm brad the original source be tammy mhm brad or even as that tape be tammy mhm brad there be gon na be some loss tammy mhm brad in the generation of make that copy tammy mhm brad h and tammyi there a way to avoid that loss i mean how brad tammy brad well you   be you   be gon na have that loss just because of all the different thing involve tammyright brad f from take it from one tape and put it on the other tape tammy right right bradthere   be a lot of thing in the signal path there tammy right brad tammyso you   be you   be bind to lose something brad yeah it   be not huge tammy no matter what bradyou know it may be ten percent tammyokay brador five percent tammyright brador something like that tammy right right brad uh which be a small amount and you   will st still be able to enjoy the cough the music and the message it   be try to bring across tammy mhm mhm mhm okay bradso tammyokay bradi do   not see a problem in that um the other thing i realize be uh think about how much of the time you   be gon na be do that tammy mhm brad because of you be pay a decent premium to have that convenience tammy mhm mhm mhm so what kind of price difference be we talk about suppose i just get one tape brad oh okay tammy and let my friend copy tape for me and brad okay tammy yeah bradum tammy right brad like let   be say there would be about tammy brad um couple different step okay tammyokay bradone would be a single cassette deck tammy brad um that would uh play the tape you know and after side a   be do then you have to take the tape out and flip it over and play side b tammy okay okay brad okay tammyright bradthat would be your first level tammy right brad and luxman have a great cassette deck to fill those need tammyokay brad and um tammy brad all of their cassette deck come with a five year part and labor warranty so the quality   be tammymhm brad you know put into them uh tammy mhm brad they really put a lot into them to be able to give that kind of warranty tammymhm brad h and um they   be pretty conservative in their uh specification where what they say their cassette deck will do they will y usually out perform that tammy okay brad and with the unit you already have the receiver that have the full remote control tammy right brad all the unit uh you   be look at here will uh go along with that tammy mhm brad and um as far as the remote control funtion go tammyright bradwhere the remote control will control the deck tammy right right okay brad the deck come with tammy brad what   be call a din cable and that plug into the unit you have now tammy mhm right brad okay this be the kay one eleven tammy okay brad this would be i guess you   would say the entry level tammy right brad to integrate into your system tammy okay brad h um this give you a lot of plus that most people   be basic deck do   not have tammyhm brad okay it have dolby tammy mhm brad which as you know that   be a circuit to cut the tape hiss without cut the high frequency tammy right right brad and um regular dolby be dolby b that   be like um tammy mhm brad when you buy tape at the wherehouse they   be in dolby tammy right brad um in addition to that it give you dolby c tammy mhm brad when you   be make your own tape at home like let   be say from the cd tammy hm mhm brad make a tape to play back on this tape deck tammy mhm bradyou   be gon na wan na record it in dolby c tammymhm bradthat   be gon na sound sonically superior tammy mhm brad um or if friend be record tape in dolby c then you   will be able to play it back and it   will sound right tammy hm okay brad okay so if something   be record in dolby b you wan na play it in dolby b dolby c you wan na play it in dolby c you do   not want to tammy mhm brad mix and match uh tammyokay brad the it do   not sound quite right tammy nkay brad so this give you that tammyhunh brad it also give you what   be call h pro tammy okay mhm brad which be a feature usually only find in rh really expensive cassette deck tammymm hm bradh and that i be an improvement in the recording section of it tammyhm brad and it allow you to record a little bit tammy mhm bradum high record level so you hear less tape hiss tammy mhm mhm brad and also have a little bit more um high frequency response tammy hm mhm bradokay so this one here you   be look at three hundred eighty dollar tammymhm hm mhm brad okay and um from there the next step for what you   be look at would be the kay one ten okay the kay one ten basically have all function that we just talk about on the on the kay one eleven tammy mhm brad um tammy brad with the addition of the convenience feature of have auto reverse tammy yeah brad and that   be nice just like in the car tammy brad where tammyyeah brad it will play side b after side a be finish automatically tammy yeah brad where you do   not have to get up and flip the tape tammy okay brad the other thing about it be you can flip the tape over at any point in the middle tammy mhm right brad uh and the other thing y let   be say if you   be entertain you can put in a ninety minute tape tammy mhm brad put it on continuous auto reverse tammy m mhm brad have a recording of your favorite song tammy right mhm bradfor a party tammyright brada dinner party whatever tammyright brad and play side a then side b then side a side b tammy yeah that   be good bradit   will just go forever tammythat   be good bradokay tammyokay brad um tammy right brad so that   be what it give you in the kay one ten tammy mhm brad now the dual or double cassette deck that luxman offer be basically a um double version of the kay one ten tammyright brad and they call it the kay one ten double u tammy okay brad and tammyso what   be the price difference here brad oh okay i   be sorry the tammyyeah bradthe kay one ten be four hundred eighty dollar tammy alright brad and the kay one ten double u be five hundred eighty dollar tammymhm okay brad okay so you pay a hundred dollar premium for auto reverse then you   be pay another hundred dollar to have tammy yeah right brad double cassette deck that   be auto reverse tammy okay mhm okay brad um the convenience on this be obvious tammy mhm brad where um they even have tammy brad um you know button set up for tammy mhm brad dub or copy tammy mhm bradfrom one tape deck to the other tammy mhm brad um so it   be really set up to be just crank out tammy hm brad uh copy tammymhm brad now the other thing be it have a feature where it will do it in half the time tammy hm brad or high speed dub tammy hm hm hm hm brad which be sometimes nice so it do   not take the whole period of time tammyright brad to make your copy tammy mhm brad and it will continue make the copy you know from side a then and it   will flip over tammyright bradand to side b um so we we   have talk about it how how it have the dub speed select button tammy mhm bradso you can make a a high speed copy tammy mhm brad um the other thing that set this apart from a lot of other dual deck be it have a separate dolby button for each cassette deck tammy stifle mhm brad ge uh gesundheit tammy thank you yeah bradum where a lot of unit will tammy hm brad just have a dolby setting tammy mhm brad and that   be the same for both deck tammy i see i see brad but there may be a situation where a friend of yours tammyyeah mhm brad who   be a real audiophile make uh tammymhm brada real premium tape for you tammymhm bradrecorde in dolby c tammymhm brad well you wan na record it in dolby b so you can play it back in your walkman tammy mhm brad and in your automobile   be cassette player tammy mhm mhm brad uh in that scenario you   be gon na want to play it back in dolby c but record it in dolby b tammyyeah okay bradokay tammy that   be good brad so this give you that convenience tammy nkay brad now the other thing be let   be say h um that friend of your come over for dinner with his prize tape tammymhm brad and you have your prize tape tammymhm bradof of something else you could load them both up tammymhm mhm brad put it on continuous tammy brad um tammy unhunh brad auto reverse and it will play side a side b of one tape tammy brad go over to the other tape tammy right bradand play se ai tammy mhm brad side a then side b and it continually go forever tammy right okay brad um tammy hunh brad which be kinda nice tammy wow brad now the other thing you can do with this deck be tammy yeah brad in your system you can make a copy from tape to tape while you   be listen to something else tammy blowsnose brad nkay tammy unhunh bradso you could be listen to your cd tammyright bradwhile you   be make a tape copy tammyright that   be right okay brad um the other thing you can do be um as i recall one can listen to the tuner tammy brad so you could put on kdb tammy mhm brador i i tammyright brad r there   be one matt like i forget what it   be call but anyhow tammy right brad um tammy brad or he want to get kfac i think it be tammyyeah brad which be kind of tough um so you could be listen to the radio while tape a cd tammymhm brad you you know tammyright bradit allow you to do that tammy right right okay brad which you have to pay attention to what you   be do tammy okay i know that   be right yeah brad yeah but at least you have that flexibility tammy okay brad and so it sound like tammy bradfrom what you   have tell me uh you know about you   be desire to make good quality copy of tape tammy mhm mhm brad this be gon na be the tape deck tammymhm bradthat would fit your need tammymhm brad and integrate well with your system and tammy right bradallow the remote to fully control it tammy okay well what you   have say help me a lot i actually may i mean i do   not do this so often and it may well be that i i   would do better just go back to one of these other brad mhm tammy um in brad the oth tammy in fact i   be bradthe oth the other thing i be gon na say be be it do you have um if you have some other type of quality cassette deck tammy mhm brad even if it be a unf tammy mhm brad one in the office or uh tammymhm yeah brad a portable or something like that tammy mhm brad i could somehow hook it up into your system tammy mhm brad so you could tape from it tammy right right brad to one of these tammy right okay that   be possible brad and the the price i give you be the uh luxman suggest price tammyright brad since you   have buy couple piece here tammymhm brad and also be through the fire i   be sure we can work something else out for you tammy mhm bradi do   not know tammy okay brad how well h let   be see here um the kay one eleven which be the the basic one tammyright brad but h i do   not when i say basic i mean basic in their line tammyright bradit   be still very good tammyyeah brad uh you   would be look at three hundred forty nine dollar tammy nkay brad the uh let   be see here the kay one ten tammymhm brad uh we could do four hundred and forty five tammy right brad and the kay one ten double u uh we could do five thirty nine tammy mhm okay well that look great brad and i th i believe there   be one that we do   not talk about and that   be the kay one twelve tammy mhm brad okay and the kay one twelve be basically the audiophile   be dream cassette deck tammy brad okay tammy mhm bradit   be a it   be a single cassette and it   be single direction tammymhm brad where it do   not flip over by itself tammy right brad what set it apart be it have three discrete head tammy hunh brad okay and this will make a superior tape copy tammyhm brad um or a superior tape period um tammy hm brad because it have three head tammy hm brad and what it do be that it have a separate head for record a separate head for play tammy hm bradwhere most deck have a combination record play head tammy unhunh brad and um this also have some adjustment on it uh such as bias fine trim tammy hm brad uh which allow you to tailor the cassette deck   be electronic to the specific tape you   be use tammymhm brad so obviously you can see there   be tammyright brad a b a bit more involved with it tammy yeah yeah brad for the purist this be the way to go here you   be look at six hundred dollar tammy okay brad tammyokay right okay well this be very helpful let me ask you one other thing brad tammy suppose that i wan na use this tape deck to record um conversation like we do in in linguistic between matt and me or something like that brad okay tammythen how do it work let   be say go back to the kay one ten brad uh tammy or the one bradthere   be one deck here i think that   be set up for that tammy or the one el eleven brad let   be take a look here the kay one ten tammy mhm brad have provision for microphone on the front tammyunhunh brad and it   be one of the few cassette deck tammyokay bradmade for the consumer hi fi market today tammy bradthat do have that tammyokay brad h and so you can plug in one microphone tammy yeah brad uh where it have a position uh that   be mono tammy mh hunh brad and it will record it on both track of it tammy mhm brad tammymhm bradand then if you want tammyhm bradyou can plug in two mic and it sense when you plug in the second mic tammy hm okay bradand so it   will record in stereo tammy okay brad and then it have a record level on it tammyhmhm brad so you can adjust the record level tammy mhm braddependent on how loud you   be talk tammy mhm brad and then also the type of tape you   be use tammymhm brad and the level you want on the tape tammy hm hm brad uh so the kay one ten would be set up for that tammyhunh brad any of the other um cassette deck here tammymhm brad the kay one eleven have it too i take tammyhunh bradi i take it back tammy huh bradi do   not think the kay ele lev one eleven do tammy unhunh unhunh brad okay it   be the it   be the dual one that do   not tammy okay brad the dual one do not have those provision now that do   not mean that it can not be do tammy right brad what have to happen then be uh one hook up a tammy mhm brada separate outboard piece call a microphone amp tammyokay brad okay and so what happen be your mic run into it tammymhm brad and then it plug into your receiver tammymhm bradinto one of its input tammy okay brad and so one of your input on your receiver tammy brad let   be say tape two toddyell paul tammymhm bradwould actually be a microphone todd run run tammymhm toddyeah brad and so you would hit that toddyeah tammy mhm brad and that would um todd paul save my ass yell brad go over tammy mhm bradum tammy nkay brad into your tape deck if you want to record a tape tammy right right okay so um m brad so the kay one ten which be the single auto reverse tammy yeah bradhas the mic provision tammyright brad the kay one eleven have the mic provision tammyand so   be the kay one okay great okay brad the b the benefit of the one ten the big benefit be the auto reverse tammy right brad um tammy i   be one of these weird people that have trouble with auto reverse brad oh yeah tammyi do   not know why the first time i mean this be the first time i   have have it on my boombox and for some reason maybe i just have to learn when i put the tape in i never know which direction it   be gon na go so i have a hard time find bradwhat you want tammymake it play what i want it to play brad okay the way it usually work be tammy brad um tammy bradthe side of the tape that   be out or face you that label side tammy mhm mhm brad correspond with the arrow that will point to the right there   be usually two little arrow that will light up tammy nkay yeah bradtelle you which direction it   be play tammy right right brad okay the arrow that point to the right tammy i see brad be the label side of the tape that   be face you tammy okay brad that you can see tammyokay brad okay that   be the way it usually work tammy okay brad now the other thing that throw people off be tammy brad fast forward and rewind tammymhm brad will vary depend on which side of the tape you   be on tammy right right right brad okay that   be what throw people off tammy yeah brad all the time tammy yeah i just um i   will i   will work on get use to that but i just might go with the single you know the one that i have to turn it over brad oh tammyi mean brad you know that   be fine tammy you know bradthat   be fine um tammy brad i   be try i mean i have a couple recently uh bodecker uh get the kay one eleven and and they love it tammy yeah bradthey do   not play tape that much tammy yeah that   be the same with me too yeah i   be really into cd   be now brad unhunh yeah tammyso bradbut they have a couple of these box set of uh tammy right bradsymphonie tammyright brad and then i think they even have a couple book on tape tammyyeah brad and for that it   be perfect tammy right bradyou know it   be probably w more than enough tammy right brad tammy right bradum i   be just try to look and see what other difference there be tammy okay bradi i mean i really think those be the that   be the big difference tammy this be no this be great brad um sing doo doo sing i believe yeah i think that   be the basic difference be that auto reverse tammy h let me ask you do you sell microphone brad tammy here brad uh we do   not really athanse nya nya nya nya nya nya tammy kay bradget into them tammynkay bradum we be athan nya nya nya nya nya nya bradum athanyou ca   not get me sing bradconnecte with a distributor that do deal with them tammy okay brad and so we we   have get them for client time to time athantry to get me tammy okay brad um i think we have them available from sony and i   would really have to l research that a bit for you tammy that   be okay i i can follow through on that you have any idea how much a good brad okay tammy sort of um table mic would cost um brad well um you can get one tammy brad f ah s i would say i would expect to pay h maybe f f forty dollar and up tammy okay bradi mean really the sky   be the limit with microphone tammy right right bradi mean you can get tammy okay bradn thousand dollar microphone tammy okay bradbut um you would proba i would spend you know i would   not spend nineteen dollar tammy mhm mhm bradi   would spend forty buck tammyyeah yeah okay brad and then maybe a little up above that tammy nkay mhm brad for what you wan na do i i do   not ever see pay you know a couple hundred dollar tammy mhm bradthat that would probably be tammy right brad f very overkill tammyokay brad so that kind of give you an idea tammy mhm right brad tammyokay bradum there   be a place to look um call sound advice tammy yeah alright brad okay there   be a guy there name wayne tammy yeah okay brad he   be uh tammy that   be a good idea bradone of the principal there wayne tammy okay bradi think his name be shaybeck tammy alright brad saybeck shaybeck something like that and he   be a really knowledgeable guy tammyokay bradhe   be be in the business for a long time tammygreat brad uh and they   be good guy there tammy okay brad so that would be a a place to look at a mic tammy okay that   would be great yeah h um if we need to d get a price on a tape r recorder that we lose see what we lose be a tape recorder not a tape deck bradokay tammyit be a fancy uher that name ring a bell bradare y oh really it be tammyyeah bradoh gosh tammyright bradth that   be tammy bradlike tammybut brad consider i mean there   be a lot of different model of uher tammymhm brad but uh they   have always be consider probably one of the fine portable cassette recorder tammy mhm mhm yeah right brad uh w our blue book usually show the uhers tammy yeah bradour old uher tammy okay brad so i could show you what the blue book price be tammy then if i nkay brad it   be gon na be hard to d tammy okay bradi do   not know uher that well it   be gon na be hard to determine tammy mhm brad what would be a comparable replacement today tammy i know right yeah brad and that would be something you may wan na run by wayne tammy okay great nkay you do   not sell that kind of thing here right cause this be an audio brad that   be right tammy place bradwell i mean tammyokay brad to tell you the truth th sometimes we do get them for people tammy mhm okay bradthrough the distributor we deal with tammy yeah brad but uh tammy yeah okay brad overall tammy well bradusually we do   not tammy this be great yeah what i think i   will do be um take these idea back to matt brad okay tammyand i   will be back brad sleep on it tammy then yeah brad yeah tammy yeah i need to think about what you tell me bradh tammybut this be very helpful for me brad okay tammyi really appreciate it bradjust for your knowledge um tammy bradthe kay one ten and the kay d one ten double u tammy mhm brad that   be the auto rev single auto reverse tammy right bradand double auto reverse we have in stock tammy okay brad the kay one eleven tammy hm brad um i do   not believe i have in stock but we   be gon na be place a luxman order soon and since they ship out of torrance tammy mhm brad um you know lead time be   not too bad on it but just know that tammy mhm brad you could   not call me up and then listen to a tape that night tammy right okay that   be fine bradokay tammy okay um but we   be talk like maybe a week or something brad oh yeah tammyokay bradyeah tammyno problem bradif that tammyi mean listen brad if that tammy i   be not that uh brad okay tammy th the timing be   not that tight i   have wait a long time bradokay tammyfor a lot of stuff so no brad okay tammyit   be not a big problem but i appreciate your let me know about that brad okay okay um tammy okay brad pete have tell me matt come by and pick up some literature on i th guess the l l s the little speaker y we be talk about tammy right bradi do   not i do   not tammy okay bradi do   not know if he actually get the exact one i recommend or not tammy yeah bradand then uh there be an article on uh fm antennas i have recommend to him tammy mhm bradand pete make a copy of it for him tammy yeah okay bradokay tammythat   be great brad tammyyeah that be really helpful bradso do you tammy brad have you hear anything ha have he read that and he   be think tammy right bradthinking tammyyeah bradokay good tammythat be part of what we have to that be part of what we have to put in the spec we need to know the size and this whole antenna question whether you could put an antenna you talk about this with him brad okay tammyun under the roof and everyth bradyes tammy cause you know you ca   not have that stuff show bradthat   be right tammy brad that   be right tammynot where we be bradyeah tammy yeah braduh tammyokay bradhow   be the house move along tammy come along we   be gon na be put the uh spec out for bid bradgreat tammywithin the month so bradgreat tammyyeah brad that   be progress tammy so that   be bradis   not it tammyit   be progress brad tammyyeah we   be go as fast as we can we   be gon na have like four week we just have to wait while the bidding brad exactly tammy and um but brad well then if then if you sit up at night think tammy then brad should we go for him tammy i know it brador should we go for him tammy it   be just what i be tell jeff i say we get all these place in the spec where we   be we   be have to say you know k figure this one separately cause we may have to axe it you know and we   be just bite our nail cause we do   not know what th the bottom line be gon na be brad sure th yeah tammyso p maybe uh anyway brad some part of it will really surprise you tammy br yeah br bradand some part will be a lot less than you think tammy yeah like window be   not as expensive as i think so it   be bradoh tammythat   be how it   be go bradwell that   be good tammy yeah brad well you have to do double glaze up there now tammy yeah that   be true brad tammy right yeah brad um which some t which add a bit tammy yeah bradto the cost go up tammy well we   will keep you post on brad okay tammyhow it   be all go brad just let me know tammyand i   will certainly let you know about this thing um i   will be call you back bradokay tammy within a few day brad and i i think i have give you some literature before tammy yeah bradon that and it show those cassette deck in there tammy okay bradif you need an additional piece tammythat   be right bradi can i i can get you one tammy h no you   be i think you   be right brad okay tammy yeah that   be what i have look at so i think be w no you do   not have the bradi have the d the tammyone bradthe double one here tammy right right brad and i have the tammythat   be what i see bradthe real high end um tammymhm brad single one tammy yeah okay brad tammyalright brad the other t the other the single auto reverse i have in stock i just do   not have on display tammy yeah that   be alright yeah brad okay tammy okay good thank so much brad well that give you an idea tammyalright good brad okay good tammyi keep you five minute but i bet brad oh tammy i bet it   be be bad than that before brad it   be it   be oh this be nothing tammy brad yeah this be nothing this be a joy tammy hunh bradto tell you the truth tammy good good brad tammy well i think you   have get another sale brad okay tammy so bradokay well tammy just have to talk to matt brad thank you tammy yeah michael hm yeah jim and even if i go out and ask for it you know i say can i copy that q i wo   not feel guilty i really wo   not it   be just a set of instruction i use to program a little bit and and um those guy have so much fun write those program you know that   be the i think that   be that   be pretty michael yeah well jim that   be pretty much the end of it michaelcreative people generally do what they love to do jim yeah right and that   be pretty much the end of the truthful part of the process the rest of it be all market michael hm jimand the marketplace be uh you know maybe i think i live in tangier you know maybe i think the marketplace be uh michael jim you get what you can get michael yeah jim uh seem to be that way you know i as long as i   be not hurt another person directly michaelright jim you know or even indirectly but just throw my money out there he may never see a penny of it he may have sell the right outright you know michael jim that certainly happen in music jim heavens yes i yeah michaelyeah jim you know i mean it happen all over the place michaelyou know i wish i be uh the person whose voice they use in the telephone when it tell you the number have be change and that i have uh copyright get some royalty like that lady you know h you hear the number you have reach da duh da duh da duh da duh da duh da duh q jimthey get a different woman do   not they michael hunh jimdid   not they get a different woman when she th try to do that michaeli do   not know if they do jimthey they they hire another voice michaeli do   not hear any follow up but jimthat   be what i think that they do anyways michaelyeah hunh they certainly use her a lot but i mean it they only use what a s five second total or something you know it   be a jim probably take her a long time to to say every possible combination michael oh but they the computer do that all she have to do be say each digit and the computer jimoh that   be all it be michael yeah it   be like a series of sample jim and it automatically sort em michael unhunh jimyeah michaelright yeah so it   be probably the total actual s speak that they use be pretty short it would be much more pleasant if they have do all the combination though you know call it up and there   be something that actually say your number in toto you know jimyeah or because it recognize your phone number it automatically go into the computer find that michaelyeah jimand aand name the name michaelthat sample jim thank you mister smith for call pacific bell q michaelyeah right you know jimi be your personal computer representative q michaelthat   would be great jim michael jimpush one if you wish to know my phone number push two if you wish to h q michael my phone number that i jimyou know have dinner with me push three michael jimif you want to uh h michael artificial intelligence personality that you call up jimyeah so if you do not like this personality push zero and a new personality michaelyeah jimwill be provide for you michaelyeah jimat no extra charge michaelyeah hunh jim you be allow up to five personality in one phone call q michael jim well the networking of computer be get uh such that you know almost anything   be possible any michael yeah that   be why i like it jimit   be just matrixe and just con constantly build and building upon build upon building on these complexity and build controller for them michaelthat   be right and jimand building on top of those michaeland you   be build on the thought of th your predecessor jim michaelbut your predecessor in this case could be like last year jim michaelyou know it   be like it   be move so fast jimoh so fast michael it   be like a r jim michaelit   be a reflection of the brain and it   be communication like book but it   be much quick and it   be like jim but when they get michaelif you can think of something and define it you can make it happen if it just about information i mean you ca   not jim if it   be just about information that   be very true michaelyeah you ca   not conjure something up like a car out of nothing but jimwell with the superconductor uh that   be gon na make it you know so economical michael mhm jimfor everybody to have all the electronic this and that that they want because there   will be so little loss of electricity michael yeah and it   will be small jimyou know and it it   will be f so small that we   will have enormous amount uh we should have an enormous supply of it michael yeah like every light switch will have its own computer or something you know basically because it   will be cheap enough that cheap as a switch these day or something jimit wo   not cost anything michaelyou know jimky and it and when they go into outer space and start grow this thi those uh silicon chip without any flaw michaelhm jim they   will be able to uh grow circuitry that be so complicated that you know that gravity destroy it so they   will be able to uh michaelhm jim uh michael yeah jim to i they   will be able to get these fantastic uh circuit f like say for a whole television set just on one chip and uh michael jim uh and then it   will harden out there and k they   will bring it back a uh the whole thing be s michael jimis s be so sensational michael that   will be expensive at first jim god but can you michael grow em in space but that   be great jimyeah it   will it   will uh it   will be worth it michael in this technology out of most of uh m anything in the past ha have m it   be become like we   be shape our our destiny or ourselves um with this technology more than we have in with any other in the past it seem just blike whatever we think it b we can make it but there   be one technology that   be um gon na overtake that and that   be dna research which be like a total scam at this point still it   be they   be just like bombard rganism with radiation to see what come up you know we have very little control over it but once we do we   will be able to program biology as well jim well that   be pretty frightening concept michael it be frightening but jim we ca   not even control our freeway michaelum i know jimyou know michael jimi mean michaelbut i the thing be any s technology that come up it get use once it   be out there in the open jim michaelthe jimwell i hope michaelthe society as a a whole jim i hope they use fractal jim be you familiar with fractal michaelunhunh jim yeah i hope they use a lot of fractal because f michaelin biology research jim no but in well the connection between mathematic and biology can be find k michaelunhunh jimuh more easily with fractal than it can with uh regular mathematic michaelyeah jim michaelyeah jim so you know i   be look for the p connection between science and and religion and and and and biology michaelmhm jimas it be ar th you know the living as spiritual and the and the michaellike the ancient science be jimand the sci and the scientific pardon michaelit be like the ancient science it be just a branch of knowledge which be include all knowledge basically jim alchemy alchemy right michael unhunh jim yeah michael whatever get the job do jimthe the the gestalt michael jim the totality be take into account as oppose to as oppose to the observer michael right jim you know i remember m back in the psychedelic day there be this poster of the scientist i   have always be on a kind of a crusade for scientific uh responsibility right and scientist be be take such control over the world these day uh with their n you know not the scientist but what they   have invent and the way it   be market and the way we   be d we develop need for it and i remember this pf cartoon i see w of of it be call the scientist and it have this this wonderful stone statue about twenty story tall of a naked man and a naked woman intertwine with each other hugging each other full frontal and their arm wrap around each other and then they s they they look like they be so intertwine and they spiral down and and they   be a s they   be a statue right michael hm jimmade out of stone and they   be and the whole base of the statue be crumble right and it   be just like rubble f like from just below the knee down be just kind of rubble but the rest of it be all real clear a few ttle some of it be chip off you know it be old but and d and down at the bottom of this this rubble be this little man who be a scientist and he have this big magnifying glass and he be look at the rubble look with his head down michael hm jimnot look up at the statue and see the love and the the the symbol there but look down at the crumb you know michaelhm jim at the rubble at the bottom with his magnifying glass and and to me that that always symbolize kind of rather clearly the limitation of the scientific method whi if it do   not take into account michael well jim the to the the the whole human experience and include the unbelievable part of it the part that be just legend and myth and and uh allude to michaelyou mean the theory jimand and the psychedelic experience and the subjective michaeloh on that side jimyou know and insanity and michael jimwhat i mean michaelwell jimyou know they michael jimthey   have get to take ac into account michael jim uh michaelbut you ca   not jimthe east with all its with all its fantastic discovery michaelbut you ca   not look at the star with a microscope and science be a microscope each pscientist have their their field of um expertise and if they   be gon na go if they   be gon na stretch out far enough into the the unknown where they can find something new they have to do it in a straight line they ca   not do it jimthat   be true michael in all direction at once because then you run into thing that we already know so the problem be communication between s jim but they   be do it they   be do it with mathematic right i mean michael well jimn no michael but the comm problem be communication between the branch of science jim mhm michaeli think jim that   be true michael cause who   be gon na be able to hold all that knowledge and make the connection jim well the philosopher and the spiritual leader and i mean cause f the stuff can be understand understand the goal michael those people can tell you jimor the or the cut cut edge can be understand understand intellectually michaelbut those people ca   not tell you the detail they know the whole structure but see jimwell the michaelit   be like both side you have to have somebody look at the detail jimy get to have a leader michaeland somebody look at the jimand you got to have a bunch of worker you know michael yeah jim and you get ta have somebody michael right jimwho dis   not necessarily inclined to deal with the detail that much who   be guide those who be willing to sit there michael i guess that   be the problem jim and make all the michaelwe do   not have a guider jim yeah there   be no l there   be no lead or there   be no focus michaelyeah jim and michael that   be right jim and uh you know i think i think that one of the reason that there   be be no focus be because h everybody accept the scientific method as the good tool that we have and be kinda let the scientific method be the michaelmhm jim be the leader the the w you know just continue inventory and michaelwell those people who be do research jim continue inventory catalog experiment you know document uh uh whatever and instead of instead of uh uh come at it from another direction try to find try to find uh try to find way to to like with with einstein for example you know uh it seem to me he be try to f the be ex per experiment with with new way of do thing you know michael well think about thing jim h uh and think about thing and he be try to he w i think he be ultimately try to try to discover the speed of his own thought michaelhm jimyou know i mean he be like really off into wonderful abstract notion that be all base in a peaceful world michael jimyou know that could   not exist unless he be secure that we have a peaceful world or that that peace be part of it of what he be about and so much of today   be technology be soulless and have nothing to do with peace it have to do with just generally chew up you know consumerism basically and michael mhm jim chew up ch n j chew up new w uh chew up the human experience and turn it into some kind of consumer need michael do you ever get into tesla jim uh just ever so peripherally michael he have a lot of real wacky idea on big level he want a world power system that you could um tap into the air basically and get power anywhere on earth and um y jimthat   be what the tesla coil be about michaelyeah but e the problem be that it it uh it interfere with um well matter i mean y it be not a clean broadcast system like everything in the room if you have a tesla coil in the middle of the room all the metal object would be receive it constantly jim mhm michael so it be   not really a very efficient either because you   would have to have a an immense amount of power being broadcast so that a few point could receive you know their share of it jim now what about if they with the superconductor will that change all that michael i do   not know he be deal with it be basically energy and be send through the air uh you know like light jimlike yeah like tap right into just the energy of the earth or something alright michaelyeah which do   not really require a conductor jimyeah may michael you know i mean light will go through a vacuum so i think he be i mean he va basically invent the radio and stuff like that you know jim it   be pretty confusing to me but uh yeah those those guy be the guy i think that be the hero uh or that be the unsung heroes michaelyeah jimyou know the r the uh and s and and business and i mean this be a cliche but but business have always uh take these work and and manipulate em either to their benefit or to our benefit or to our detriment or something f base on economic wh what the obvious or the michaelhm jim more immediate economic michael right it   be like well gee yeah i know i know how we can make money with this i mean you just do it jimyeah well that   be what i like about fractal be because uh uh with these new mathematical formula michaelmhm jimeven though you know because it   be mathematical and it i it have to work i guess with number in it somew some way uh it   be open a door into what appear to be all the substance that   be underneath the obvious you know michaelhm jimwith if if regular math be the obvious uh these fractal seem to seem to represent everything that number be   not and uh that   be michael well something that number be   not i do   not think it   be everything jim not everything but s michaelcause there be t jimbut the first window into that michael yeah well it like every theory be just like it   be a window and it   be also like a model of um reality and it   be really not reality and uh like a fractal can get really close at do like describe growth pattern like a plant or something jim yes yes right right michael um but it   be still n not the totality of a plant jimno it be   not by any stretch but for mathematic or for science it   be the it   be an opportunity for them to michaelit   be the close thing we have jim to yeah to get close to to the chaos or the or the order of chaos michaelmhm uh that exist uh uh a h as subtext to our life to our experience on this planet and when we   be michael mm jim and when we   be say when we   be go to uh say blow up the first atomic bomb and and and we do   not bother to ask the american people or the people of the world if w if if we mind michael jim uh if there   be a chance you know cause they do   not know for sure whether it would destroy the universe or not michael yeah or not jim and it might have start a chain reaction that just blow up the whole earth jimthat   be right and it might very well still have start that chain reaction and that it   be all happen in fractal country and it have michaelaah jimand it and it   be manifest itself in in disharmony uh in in the deterioration of the planet we   be all worried about the ozone we   be all worried about the uh michaelhm jimuh th cancer be everywhere uh michael so you   be say it might have do the same bad thing but in a sort of more roundabout way jim it   be just that the uni except that the universe be such a complex phenomenon that it   be so deep it   be for f the fabric that we be witness through m science and through any know ability to understand michaelmm jim be just a thin shell from how deep this phantasmagorical experience go and that when they do that it   be possible that they start a chain reaction at such a subatomic level a sub sub sub sub subatomic level michaelit   be gon na take a while to crumble jim that it   will take a while before it it it really you know vr go roar you know and just rip it apart michael yeah jimit might take it might take a a few th it might take five hundred year or a thousand year michaelyeah jimor a hundred year or maybe it   be be w maybe in v fifty year or it might never happen but it   be to me that be scientific irresponsibility and w without the knowledge of of f what fractal symbolize at this point to me uh they w they could make that decision easier and with the scientif michaelfractal could have make the decision easy jim no no without the knowledge of fractal the decision be make easy if fractal be know at that time michaeloh jim there might have be a little more caution because there be there   be this window michael but fractal do   not uh do   not imply any particular moral jim well they imply no they do   not imply moral but they do imply that there   be more than the obvious going on michael well all math do that jim uh not to me uh it   be michael they   be just another system that   be all just another model jim it   be to me it   be a model it   be it   be a model into the fourth dimension as oppose to you know michael well actually jimthe third dimension michaeleinstein   be theory be a model in the fourth dimension and that   be time um but fractal can be apply to many dimension or n or just i mean any number of dimension it   be basically take something and divide it up randomly or with some system it   be like nest nest value basically inside a gallon you have four quart inside of four in inside a quart you have the certain amount of cup and then you know etcetera etcetera jim well michaeli do   not see how it   be jimyeah except it   be not it   be not uh it   be not so it   be not square and it   be not as predictable as that i mean it   be uh it   be it   be not predictable at all really it   be it   be a it   be a find phenomenon michael well it   be not predictable if you apply random value to the subdivision jim the subdivision have to be random they ha it have to have randomness to it the order i do   not think be be understand yet i mean i might be wrong but that   be my understanding michaelhm well i think jimoke that   be why they   be call it the equ they   be call it uh the mathematic of chaos oke michaeloh that   be a different thing that   be not fractal jimyeah that   be fractal oke it include other michaelwell fractal can be use to describe chaos jim it include it include oke other it i yes it can and it include other mathematic too michael but fractal be separate yeah i mean and chaos be se they overlap jim mhm michael chaos i guess be basically analysis of noise jim for for the scientist for the scientist the scientist have never hav have never have a tool where he have that overlap you see michaelhm jim see that   be w that   be the point that i   be try to get at be be that because the scientific method now have that tool of overlap it   be give them something that they never have before michael hm jim and that be an opportunity for to meet spirituality michael yeah well there   be u jim in physics michael there   be opportunity to meet spirituality twenty four hour a day wherever you go just by be alive if they do   not wan na see it they   be not gon na see it in fractal jimwell yeah a lot of people will a lot of people will uh it   will dawn on them because they follow the scientific impulse and fractal may be the very thing that boggle them out enough where they have to do some serious questioning about thing be my theory michael yeah jimyou know michael maybe they   will probably find it in something if there fractal be   not there i think um it   be like all the the idea that we have throughout the age and the various they   be just sort of echos of uh the past and they come under different name and thing just like um the late power now be corporation right and before that it be like uh government before that it be principality before that it be gang you know jim and tribes michaeland gang be come back now you know s but uh jim god be they ever michael um jim it   be unbelievable michaeland knowledge and and the pursuit of um spirituality have take on many form jimcough michael and if a person want to find it in in something they believe in and they believe in science they   will find it in science jim well that   be very true but i mean uh that i think that that that people who find spirituality in science as their f sole spiritual source be people that be fuck up the planet you know i do   not think science be the i do   not think science can be god i   have be watch two thousand and one lately you know i mean that   be what that   be all i that   be not what it   be all about but that   be a a major theme in it you know that the race between the human and the and the techno michaelmhm jim and its and its technological manifestation of well i you know i think that we build michaelit   be like be we gon na be part of it or be we gon na make it jim be it gon na m do us or be we gon na do it you know be our creation it   be like the frankenstein myth be our creation go to uh destroy us or be we go to continue michael yeah uh look at what   be on tv jimyeah i just put it on michael mandelbrot oh jimi just put it on michaelokay jim yeah michaeli see i think they be show that on the uh ad for some reason jim michael jim michael a little too hip for tv jim little too hip yeah michael so they   be color cycling right now do it zoom later i guess it must jim yeah i   have get zoom on here too and i michael where   would you tape it from jim m uh this one   be fractal fantasy which be for sale michael hunh jim and the other one be uh fractal zoom which i do   not think be available burp b and then i   have get a uh test film from ibm laboratory of uh f uh uh take a julia set into the fourth dimension michael hm jim which th and then they zoom through it it   be pretty f pretty fantastic look marciathey might not actually be be um back in the barn or from the barn yet lindsey good morning this be doctor naretto at the kingman vet service kristen lindseyi see tad this morning marcia yeah lindsey um he   be look not too bad um a little bit of pain in his abdomen it   be hard to know if he just have a gastritis or gastroenteritis from chew on that dead pigeon or what the problem be um what we end up do be give him some antibiotic and send him home um if he do not improve we may need to take some ray and he   be get some bone or something in there i do   not feel anything in his belly but yeah a lot of time if they get into garbage or dead thing they   will just get an upset stomach and um also a little bit of uh well just inflamation in in there and and just feel bad so um i you know since he   be not vomit now you can go ahead and feed him and stuff and see how he do um hopefully the antibiotic will calm down any any infection that he h that he might have get from all the bacteria on the dead pigeon um but if he if he do   not get well or if he get bad be sure and let us know well but already by tomorrow he should be feel a lot well um and if he if he be   not or if he start vomit or have diarrhea we may need to see him we we w will need to see him again so um okay mhm you   be welcome mm bye marcia sh uh what do you what on your sheet what be the cost for the cast that you charge about what do we generally lindsey i think it be like fifty lindsey with the cast marcia oh lindseyto put it on marciato actually put the cast on lindseycaste material and then marcia okay lindsey and then um she have pretty much when we rechecke her she be ready to take it off so we do   not have to do any more ray or anything marciaokay lindsey i   be try to remember i think like with the white marcia you get i think you ray it you ray it with the cast on lindseyyeah mhm marcia yeah lindseyyeah yeah and it be ready to come off and we take it off she do a real good job of keep it env doorclose lindsey keep it clean and dry that   be i think half the battle cause she do   not have any sore or anything when we take it off marciamm yeah kristen for the for the tranquilizer what do we what be it again kristen ten marciaten i wonder if she would need more kristen and it   will be oh he   will yeah for a cast marcia to do a cast biotal kristen if you just biotal and metofane marcia kristen we just marcia or even kristenwe   will put him on the machine and then you do   not have to worry about em marcia what be what would that kristen that would be thirteen marcia total or thirteen extra kristen no plus thirteen for anesthesia to put this cast on cause if you do   not then y they   be wake up and you just marcia it   be bad kristen end up spend more time than if you just put em on the silly machine marciaokay lindsey yep as we know from the sheep kristen well and from other thing too just marcia yeah kristen be those good do you like em lindseyyeah do you make em kristen i make em yeah ah i be think they be more like a chocolate chip cookie bar and then as i get through the recipe i notice that they do   not have any flour in em marcia lindsey they   be good kristen so they   be actually more like granola bar than lindseythey must have yeah kristen cookie bar lindsey yeah kristen they   have get brown sugar and butter and lindsey taste like they have peanut butter kristen oatmeal and peanut butter chip chocolate chip marcia okay so a recheck would be about that much with the lindseymhm marcia ray and then wh wh do that sound right thirty two i think f we she wake up we could w send her home tonight i would   not see why we could   not send her home tonight would you lindseyif she wake up fine marcia oh well we   be gon na be biotale her and oh kristen sh if sh she probably wo   not though marcianever mind never mind i be think i   be still think kristen na marcia kristenna na na na na and she wo   not have any an antibiotic cause use all marcia no kristenand that marcia thirty two kristen what be this marciaten for anesthesia kristenoh marciabut kristenthey   be still opposite marciathey   be opposite cough kristen yeah that look all right marcia kristendo   not you think we should charge them an extra eighteen marcia for the distemper vaccine kristen trent do it marcia no kristeni feel horrible do that on that eye dog that he have in here last week under whatever night it be cause he have down twenty five plus eighteen and what can you do when he   be already get it down marciawh jeez wh marcia well well all we do i ca   not do that cause all we do be i be in here and put a bandage on lindsey yeah yeah marcia kristenum do you get hold of dan then lindsey yeah he   be marcia kristen let   be see trent six kristen let me see trent fifty six kristenlet me see we need one of these and one of these one of those and one of those and two of those marcia trentthree lindseysent home with amoxi trent fifty three lindsey and pre so we   will se how kristen yeah well i   will call him probably late this afternoon to make sure he   be all right envphonering marcia kristen there marcia no i be just try to figure out what we spend already lindseymm mm marcialet ' see we   have already spend fifty for him and i want him to spend another hundred lindsey well marciabut that   be well than pin lindsey right marcia and surgery lindseywhich would be another two hundred or kristen yeah it   be more for a surgery marcia to spend lindsey any pretty much any time you can marcia and that one really you know i do   not think it would benefit from pins lindseym m marciabecause we   would have to undo it i mean we   would have to well we   would have to go we could we could try it close lindsey mhm marcia but still it   be more expensive lindsey i think it   will do fine with a cast especially since it   be a spiral fracture marcia and it   be not displace lindseyand it   be not displace should be pretty stable it   will be kind of a pain get the well maybe not get the cast over the stifle maybe not marcia well as long as she   be lindseygot kinda long leg marciaas long as she   be quiet okay i   will give him a call i do   not know if he   be in the barn from home in back in from the barn yet or not heidi marcia well heidi call both the house number and the barn number and both of em and a little kid answer lindseymm yeah and they   be little little kid too marcia kristen heidimhm kristen lindsey they   be like on three marcia cough marcia yeah carol it   be marcia hi um we get ray do already and i be gon na let you know what what be go on should i talk to richard or you okay okay um it look like she   be get a spiral fracture of um of her tibia which be the bone between the knee and the hock and um it   be f it   be really look pretty stable it   be not displace very far anyway and it   be um pretty much you know lock in place so to speak um so i think that she would she would do fine with a cast um and i pretty much get an estimate so far with the come in yesterday and the ray and everything the bill be about fifty four and to do a cast um with the anasthesia and stay one more night in the hospital and stuff and then the cast material probably the it   be gon na be about a hundred and fifty three total and the only then it would be the only extra would be in about six to eight week we   would have her come in again we would tranquilize her and take the ray and see if it   be heal enough to take off and that   be generally about thirty four to forty somewhere in there yeah you know a pin you know if we do a pin it   be probably it would probably be even a hundred more but so it   be it   be that   be about the at this point the the least expensive alternative that probably will work for her um so if you want to let him know and then have him call me back if you kristen lindsey marciaif you wan na go ahead and do it okay kristenyou wan na put this kitty castration down lindsey sure kristen marciaalright and if she you know if we do it she could probably go home tomorrow okay whenever whenever you get a chance okay thank carol mhm bye bye cough cough lindsey gee this be the one that be too young and go back home heidi marcia she   be she   be gon na talk to him and get

all that stuff frankof grandpa ronyeah frank i think it be pretty neat and that she win that be even more remarkable jeff we often meditate i think on the love of christ and there be many way to do it and those who have meditate on the love of christ have often do so in term of the cross itself have imagine again and afresh uh his uh bleed wound uh see him as he die on the cross but audnoseblow jeff wherever we turn uh in consider the love of christ we turn always to the gospel record do   not we we we turn to the word of god we turn to the real jesus as he   be describe and uh there there be where our meditation always center aud cough cough jeff that we might know him and uh see the wonder of his love and not only hear him as he cry why have you forsaken me but uh see him also in his seek love as the rise lord uh see him uh with that fish breakfast by the lake of galilee broil fish do   not you like that you know he have that uh he have that breakfast all cooking while the disciple be still out in the boat and then uh of course he have a special interview with peter not the first time he   would see him he make a special resurrection appearance uh to peter but uh there in the morning early morning in the lake of galilee and there be cock crow in the distance and jesus say to peter do you love me more than these simon son of jonah do you love me more than these three time the question aud jeff because you see as uh we be say a bit ago the love and the service go together do   not they if peter be to be restore in service he have to be restore in love and when peter say uh i love you then jesus say uh feed my sheep tend my lamb care for my little one we we ca   not love other in the name of christ unless the love for other be a overflow of our love for the lord himself the people that we   be call to love be unfortunately not uh warrantably lovable we uh the source of our love be not how appealing they be although we can praise god for his image in them and rejoice in the many evidence of god   be common grace in their life but nevertheless uh basically the the fountain of our love i be uh the seek love of the savior the self deny love that be uh willing to serve in his name do you love me you know jesus do   not ask peter those question to undercut his love or his faith he ask those question to establish it and uh jesus do the same with you my friend he do the same he do ask you this morning do you love me do you really love me but he ask it in order that you   will be able to say at last with peter lord you know everything you know my heart and lord you know that in spite of everything yes lord i do love you well the save love of uh the father and the son be also the save love of the spirit and that   be why i read that section from romans eight uh you see god   be love be be present in the spirit there there   be a wonderful theology of the spirit in uh in the scripture especially of course in the new testament um bultmann in his uh commentary on uh romans eight uh talk about uh the two way in which the spirit i be speak of and uh h he unfortunately use anthropological term to describe it uh he talk about uh the the the spirit in uh the sense of mana as in uh animism where the spirit you have a spirit of of a tree or a a stone or something like that and then you have the more personal concept of the spirit uh uh both an impersonal and a personal concept of the spirit now i d i do   not care for his analogy but uh the point be well take uh the point be that paul do speak of the spirit both as possessor and as possess you see the spirit possess us uh as christians we be not demon possess we be holy spirit possess and uh holy spirit possession have a close relationship to demon possession uh the close relationship be what make it so different you see uh demon possession be always destructive because uh satan ca   not create and the demon possess man in gadare remember uh he could   not even give his name when jesus ask him what his name be uh he his personality be destroy you know how c s lewis have do that in his uh uh adult novel uh uh but uh there it be s emon possession be personality destructive it depersonalize because uh satan can only corrode he ca   not create he can only destroy but holy spirit possession be no less real possession only it have the opposite effect the holy spirit you see be the creator spirit who bring uh order out of chaos the holy spirit be the one who order the holy spirit be the one who free uh liberate uh the uh the the the gadarene demoniac think he be free because nobody could tie him up you see aud jeffhe could go anywhere do anything uh absolute freedom right and he could treat people he hi he do   not have to dress any particular way no dress code and so he strip it all off and the he uh he could uh d treat people any way he want to so whenever they come by he beat them up and uh aud cough cough jeff and uh then if there be nobody handy to beat up he pick up a stone and uh tear his own flesh apart there   be demonic liberty but uh holy spirit liberty do   not work that way see uh uh now m you   will accuse me of think uh of holy spirit liberty in too strictly presbyterian term because uh aud jeff i remind you that that man once he be deliver be seat clothe and in his right mind manylaughter jeffuh and and we   will pass over other uh uh scriptural account aud cough jefflike the lame man heal by the beautiful gate at the temple who go in leaping and dancing and praise the lord manylaughter jeffsee that uh that   be a little different but cough cough cough but uh you presbyterians want to do everything decently and in order uh but but the holy spirit remember be the spirit of both right he   be the spirit of order he   be the spirit of ardor and and the holy spirit uh uh s the one uh who have uh order our life and as he possess us he order us and he give us the order of love if you love me jesus say keep my commandment uh i wan na say a little bit more about that in a moment the obedience of love but the holy spirit be the one who order our life uh control our life be in possession of our life but the holy spirit   be also give to us see he   be not only the possessor he   be also the one who be possess we possess him he dwell in our heart uh we have not only the gift of the spirit in the plural but we have the gift of the spirit we have the holy spirit himself give to us the promise of the father uh they the disciple be to wait until that great promise be give the gift of the holy spirit and so the holy spirit give to us uh f work in us uh that sense of the presence of god   be love and that   be why uh paul say in romans five that god pour out his love in our heart by the holy spirit now there the love that   be pour out do not describe the love that we have for god although that be the fruit of the spirit you know love joy peace so on uh but n that passage in romans five paul be   not talk about uh the gift of love that we have for god he   be talk about the gift of love that god have for us because he go on to describe that love of god god commend his love toward us in that while we be yet sinner christ die for us so it   be god   be love for us that   be pour out in our heart by the holy spirit give to us which be uh again uh a wonderful reality because if god do   not do that uh we would   not have a love for god there   be no spring of that divine love within us it come from him and it do come from him and he do give it and so the spirit be the spirit of uh adoption the spirit of sonship now to be the spirit of sonship he have to be also the spirit of fatherhood right uh to make us aware that we be child of god uh we have to know that he be our father and so it be the love of god make real to our heart the knowledge that he do love us that he be present with us that uh become of course then the source of our uh love toward him um uh friend aud cough jeffuh there   be there   be nothing more important for the whole balance and stability and progress and growth of our christian life than to realize again and again and again the uh the wonder of our union with jesus christ through the spirit because it   be in jesus christ that we be united to the father and it be by the spirit that christ be present in our heart and it   be by the spirit that the father be present in our heart two aspect of union with christ i i think you all know this theology but it always pay to think about it again the representative union the vital union the representative union the basis of our salvation when christ die we die because he die for us he die as our representative he die in our place uh he die as uh uh the one uh who bear our sin in his own body on the tree so he be our representative right and he represent us not only as paul teach not only when he die for us but when he rise for us and then he ascend into the heavenly place and where he be we be and that   be why paul say in ephesians that we be in the heavenly place in christ jesus why representatively where he be we be now that   be a tremendously important of course foundational life transform truth it   be happen see you be a a new creature in christ because you   be unite to him you have triumph over sin and death you have die to sin and paul   be reason about how we ought to live be always ground in that audcough jeff uh you know in colossian uh it   be because christ rise that we be to seek the thing which be above you be rise with christ seek the thing which be above because you die with christ therefore mortify sin in your member put to death sin because it have die in other word the imperative be always ground in the indicative because of what christ do for us therefore uh we live out of the fact the reality the accomplishment of his perfect work and do   not forget jesus not only pay the price of your sin but remember that he live a perfect life for you hx that the white robe of righteousness that you wear in that last day be the robe of christ   be righteousness so it   be all that christ do for you uh jesus be baptize for you uh let it be do to fill all righteousness the righteousness he have to fill for you see he he do it all for you but then of course the other side of it be it   be not only representative it   be also vital jesus christ be the vine and we be the branch y we   be unite to him our life be draw from christ there be the uh uh not only the the the legal uh aspect of that which christ do for us as our representative there be the vital aspect of what christ do in us as he live in us and dwell in us and have fellowship with us and and we walk with him uh uh every uh y y you know i t   be uh it   be be long fashionable in theological circle to uh sniff at the hymn uh i walk in the garden alone while the dew be still on the rose you know uh all this uh romantic business and uh and not a shred of theology in the whole hymn and yet everybody perversely seem to love it uh well uh uh i i i think i think the reason it   be so love in spite of its uh uh uh theological vacuity uh be that it   be uh experientially manylaughter jeffuh retty much on target we   have all know those uh precious time of uh of genuine fellowship with the lord that uh that we can describe only with great difficulty and uh it   be true you see uh we be vitally united to jesus christ uh we do know him and the knowledge that we have of him be the knowledge of love we just simply love him uh we uh ow the mystics the christian myth mystics l love to talk about we   have get some kind of time constraint here what uh uh what manylaughter jeffw w w when do we dani think jeffwhen dani think we   be do when you be so jeff well i i get ta be dan finish what you have to say jeff i i well i   will i yeah let me try to finish what i   be talk about here but but uh there there i do   not often get chance to talk to type like you you know it   be wonderful manylaughter jeff uh it   be particularly wonderful cause i know you know everything i   be say anywaysso you can smile affirmatively and that encourage me that   be great uh but throat manylaughter jeffbut uh but really the the that uh you know the christian mystics talk about climb jacob   be ladder and uh uh you you you   would come up the ladder and when you get at the top you fle yourself down at the very gate of heaven and maybe uh maybe the gate will open y you ca   not control it you do   not know when it will open but maybe it will open and when it open then uh it   be uh light burst in your inner heart and uh once you   have have that experience you   would give anything to have the experience repeat and so uh you go through any amount of discipline and uh try out different form of discipline and uh you recite the jesus prayer thousand of time with the monk of mount athos and uh and uh sooner or later uh you think it may happen uh the uh you you may gain that experience well now uh you know there be experience of ecstasy tha uh that can be induce by a transformation of consciousness and uh i think christian sometimes have uh uh mingle that uh psychological experience uh whether it   be the left part or or the right part of the brain take over or something i do   not think um uh the um the psychologist be as sure as they once be or even the neurologist about how some of those thing happen but uh uh at any rate uh you see aud cough jeff it be   not that we have to climb the ladder and uh i   be i   be sorry that that whole episode with jacob get misunderstood all because uh all because of the hebrew preposition al that uh be   not take account of uh that see uh he he stand uh upon not it ee he jacob st see the stairway not a painter   be ladder of course but a a tower of babel type of thing a uh a zigarot r right you get a zigarot and which be make for the god to touch down at the top and then they could come down uh to the bottom you know it be like a little heliport for the god there that be he idea manylaughter jeffbut but uh th they they   would come down there   would be a temple at the bottom and then uh the god could be with the people but uh aud jeff uh but it it be   not that that god that that uh jacob see god at the top of the ladder up in heaven uh god stand uh upon him uh the the masculine uh there the uh v v v vowel with the little dot over it you know the the the holem uh he he he   be uh h he stand upon him uh which be the common hebrew expression and you know that   be what it be because the second time when god appear to b h uh j jacob at bethel uh the same expression be use he go up from upon him see uh it   be the same expression so god have come down the ladder that   be what we miss he be   not stand up there at the top uh he come down the ladder and uh when he come down the ladder he stand over jacob and reveal himself to jacob and that   be why jacob say this be the house of god this be the gate of heaven it be the house of god he say because god be in this place and i do   not know it see it it   be this be bethel here because here god have come to us so god be reveal himself to jacob and god reveal himself to us he come to us and uh he seek us as we seek him and our love be always in response to his love and it   be the assurance that your god love you that he seek you that he   be with you that he come to you it   be this assurance that draw you to repentance and draw you to faith and draw you to himself um the uh h salvation be of the lord and uh it   be the lord   be love who quicken your love well i   be not go to say uh th the rest of the thing i i have in mind to say but uh i you can fill out the talk for me would you please sometime the the commitment of love the obedience of love if you love me keep my commandment um remember uh mary   be adoration uh when she uh bring the spikenard and uh open it and pour it out on the foot of jesus just before he go to the cross and judas criticize her remember uh because he say this could have be give to the poor uh he he he be the first old fashioned liberal do   not worship jesus but help the poor uh but uh manylaughter jeff uh y you see uh uh w what what be the answer what be the answer that jesus uh give uh uh n let her do this let her keep it not in the sense of preserve the ointment she be pour it out but in the sense of observe it observe a a an observance against his burial uh so she realize what his death mean and she realize who he be he say the poor you have with you always but me you have not always a tremendous assurance of his own deity who else could say something like that hunh but jesus say it and uh uh you see what that say to us uh if our lord be here then we could pour out perfume on his foot he   be not here but who be the poor you have with you always so whose foot can we anoint the foot of the poor in his name see uh love uh uh do   not mean h climb up jacob   be ladder to the heavenlie where nobody else can be around the love of god be experience in the community of the saint it   be experience as we all reach out reach out to the breadth and the length and the height and the depth and the love of god be experience in the course of service a i hear you describe some of these service project that uh um intervarsity be involve in and friend um these these project even if uh they   be work about rebuild old house or whatever they be not thing that have nothing to do with love they be work of love they be the evidence of that love of god in our heart uh they be the fruit that be bear by the tree that have the root down into the water of god   be refresh grace and love and uh the mystical height of christian devotion ought never to be separate from the reality of uh christian service the uh there be a hymn in the old intervarsity hymnal it   be not in the new one by a hymn that i love v very much talk about how we go with jesus through the desert and through uh the suffering and the trial of this life and uh its very last verse be uh read he who in his hour of sorrow bear the curse alone i who through the lonely desert trod where he have go he and i in that bright glory aud cough jeff one deep joy shall share mine to be forever with him his that i be there read my friend in the wonder of god   be love he   be pleased with you god who look at his own son and his heart rejoice his heart rejoice this morning in your praise in your worship in the service of your hand in the love of your heart shall we pray our heavenly father we can not find word to express our love for you because we be overwhelmed by your love for us lord jesus how may we speak to you of that which you give to us spirit of god how we

daylight beat out of me and uh but i confront my fear you know i wan na talk a little bit about fear today aud walt uh cause i believe it   be something that keep us from do everything we can do as human being the potential that god have give us and i believe it also really keep us from aud walt a strong spiritual walk with god manymurmuragreement aud walt let   be open to mark chapter uh five verse thirty five read that day when evening come he say to his disciple let us go over to the other side leave the crowd behind they take him along just as he be in the boat there be also other boat with him a furious squall come up and the wave break over the boat so that it be nearly swamp jesus be in the stern sleeping on a cushion read hey man read the disciple wake him and say to him teacher do   not you care if we drown q he get up rebuke the wind and say to the wave quiet be still then the wind die down and it be completely calm he say to his disciple why be you so afraid do you still have no faith aud cough read they be terrify and ask each other who be this q even the wind and the wave obey him read let   be go on well read they go across the lake to the region of gera uh gerasene when jesus get out of the boat a man with an evil spirit come from the tomb to meet him read i do   not think he walk up and shake his hand we   be gon na see that in a second walt read this man live in the tomb and no one could bind him anymore not even with a chain aud cough walt for he have often be chain hand and foot but he tear the chain apart and break the iron on his foot no one be strong enough to subdue him night and day among the tomb and in the hill he would cry out and cut himself with stone when he see jesus from a distance he run and fall on his knee in front of him he shout at the top of his voice f what do you want with me jesus f son of the most high god f swear to god that you wo   not torture me f for jesus have say to him come out of this man you evil spirit q then jesus ask him what be your name my name be legion q he reply for we be many q and he beg jesus again and again not to send them out into the area a large herd of pig be feed on the nearby hillside the demon beg jesus send us among the pig allow us to go into them q he give them permission and the evil spirit come out and go into the pig aa the herd about two thousand in number rush down the steep bank into the lake and be drown those tend the pig run off and report this in the town and countryside and the people go out to see what have happen when they come to jesus they see the man who have be possess by the legion of demon sit there dress in his right mind and they be afraid those who have see it tell the people what have happen t what have happen to the demon possess man and he tell about the pig as well then the people begin to plead with jesus to leave their region read and i   be gon na stop right there p you know as we look at this we see that the disciple be afraid they be terrify of what have happen in the boat you know what it   be like to be terrify have you ever be terrify aud cough manymurmuragreement walt i mean that   be a pretty scary thing be   not it manymurmuragreement waltbee terrify be a very very scary word especially if you   have experience it maybe you be in a car wreck one time i be in a car wreck come back from indianapolis one time we be go sixty mile an hour and we   be go down the freeway and all of a sudden this woman pull out of the ramp trailor truck hit his brake he s he   be he   be behind us i think he   be come

and i have to crawl out through a window to get out of the car i be terrify i know that feel that   be what the disciple be feel at that time they be terrify they do   not understand what be go on and then we see the demon possess man he be um really think about how possess he really be he be strong enough to break iron aud yep walton his wrist and to free himself from the shackle that be on his foot and he cry out in the evening and cut himself with stone i mean he be a pretty wild guy be   not he audyep manymurmur walt but jesus take good care of him he give him back his sanity aud amen walt he give him back his mind aud yep walt and the people come out to see what have happen cause they hear about the pig walt and they come out it say they be afraid too they be afraid just like the disciple be afraid they be afraid and they ask jesus to leave the region you know it   be amazing but that fear because they do   not understand and they want to control the situation you know fear be o crippling aud walt i mean it just knock on our door every single day every single day we get up it knock on our door aud amen walt we all have different fear it kind of pull us in it entraps us it keep us from move we become immobile and that truly be what be happen to the people their response be no thi this be incredible this be the son of god look at the great miracle that he   be perform he

just need to leave our region q cause they be afraid aud mhm walt because they do   not understand and they be no longer in control but jesus be in control they realize that what jesus have do no other man could possibly do that there be something different about jesus aud that   be right walt but their fear keep them from find out exactly who jesus be do your fear keep you from know exactly who jesus be do your fear keep you from a radical relationship with god do it keep you from a personal relationship with god audcough cough walt more than just go to church on sunday go to a mid week service or even go to bible talk or group discussion or one on one study do your fear keep you from that radical personal relationship with god aud waltdoe your fear keep you from deep personal relationship with one another manymurmur walt you know the world be an interesting place we all crave that do   not we as human being a personal relationship we   be look for personal relationship we   be look for friendship be   not we many murmuragreement waltyou know c uh craig be uh uh greg be i always get those two mixed up greg and craig you look so much arike like yeah many laughter waltgreg

open their door and go to the service and it change their life manyaman walt but fear keep us from those personal relationship with one another we   be so concerned about what everybody else think audyep waltabout us audthat   be right manymurmur waltdoe   not that cripple you manyyeah walt what   be someone gon na think if they find out i   be a christian what be someone gon na think when i tell em i   be a disciple that i do   not do these thing anymore jeez what be they gon na think if i invite them to learn about jesus and to study the bible see we   be so concerned we   be afraid we   be fearful and that fear rob us of that deep personal relationship with god and that deep personal relationship with one another audmurmuramen walt we all experience it it keep us fear keep us from change our life many murmur audpreach it walter walt fear keep us from change the world manymurmuragreement walt need to overcome their fear in order that they might have that radical relationship with god the disciple need to overcome their fear in order to have a deep personal relationship with one another the disciple need to overcome their fear in order to change their life the disciple need to overcome their fear in order to change the world audthat   be right walt and if we go back and we examine the gospel aud amen waltwe see very clearly that all the time that jesus spend with them they be afraid peter be afraid thomas be afraid they be many many time afraid but they they understand the only way they would overcome their fear would be through jesus christ audmurmuragreement waltand his example because the lord have many challenging time in his life where fair where fear could be the dominant factor aud walt that could take away his relationship with god aud amen walti mean think about it you know i be uh think about fear and i guess that what prompt me about this be cause i   be fearful person aud cough walt you say oh well you   be get up here and speak in front of two or three hundred people and you know you   have do this and you   have do that and you   have do this and i   be like well yeah amen but i   be still a fearful person many murmur walt but i really wan na overcome my fear manymurmuragreement walt i wan na get aud amen walt deeper and deep with the lord i wan na get deep and deep with you i wan na get d i wan na be able to change my life and i wan na be able to change the world many murmuragreement walt you know i   have have the opportunity to r to to just really go back and read some thing outside of the bible uh on martin luther king junior cause the guy blow my mind he blow my here   be a man who die for what he believe he die to see justice equality peace walt he die for that and i   be think he be willing to drink that cup he be afraid many time but he push through his fear in order to succeed and have victory for himself and for the people that be around him the black nation of america you know we need to learn number one if we be gon na overcome our fear the first point be to face our fear in order to overcome our fear we must face our fear aud amen aud that   be right walt i w audamen walt i have the opportunity as you know to spend a lot of time with my brother he   be move in with us and just to talk and and as we be talk what come out be really his fear what he be afraid of in become a disciple in become a christian and it bring me back to the time when i be study the bible and i remember all of the fear that be in my life in c in in make a decision to follow christ you know i can remember the fear of they all wan na take my money many laughter walt that be a fear for me that be real i work hard for my money i be concerned about this cultic organization try to take my money you know i   would look at the checkbook my wife would write a check for ten dollar i   would go crazy manylaughter waltcause i be afraid they would take my money right paul yeah sure manylaughter aud walt i be afraid i be gon na lose my personality as you can see many laughter walt i   have not lose it many laughter aud amen amen waltit   be be mature manymurmur aud yeah that s yeah amen walt i be afraid i be gon na lose my identity well as you can see aud aud waltstill get one aud amen walt maybe it need to change some but i still have it i be afraid that f i   would be rob of my individuality i   would be rob of my independence and my free will f well let me tell you i   be plenty independent aud auduh oh walt and i have f a free will to choose and pick what i want to do with my life manymurmuraman waltbut what i   have choose be to overcome my fear and give my life to jesus christ manyamen walt but we must face our fear ask yourself why be you afraid think about your own fear think about your own personal fear inside your life the deep one not the outside one about money and stuff walt but the deep deep truth in your heart cause each one of us have some thing in our life that we   be very fearful about ask yourself why be i afraid aud cough waltsee we need to ask ourselves that question every single day we need to ask ourselves that question every single time it come up because in that way confront our fear it will give us a measure of success it will give us a measure of power it do   not mean we   have do it yet but when we bring it up it will give us a measure of that power it will give us a measure of success aud cough cough walt not the total victory but a small measure to understand where we   be really at audyeah audaman walt you know the thing about fear the more we attempt to ignore or repress them the more we multiply the conflict inside aud wow manymurmur audthat   be right waltis   not that true congrmurmuragreement walt you know when you   be afraid to deal with something and you   be afraid and then all of a sudden it start multiplying bbbb manylaughter waltand now you   be really afraid right manymurmuragreement waltand now you do   not want to say anything to any about anything right manylaughter waltcause it   be start to multiply and the long that fear go the more it multiplie till it get to the point where it totally immobilize you aud right till you become totally unable to move manymurmuragreement walt you become stymied aud mm walt still audcough cough walt and we know as human being just like nature if we   be not grow we   be die manymurmuragreement waltand that fear start to eat away at you you know the great thing about bring your fear up too be that when you bring your fear up what we find out many time be that they   be more imaginary than they be real aud yes manymurmuragreement waltis   not that true manymurmuragreement waltit   be like i need to talk to windham about this it   be like oh i do   not know if i wan na talk to windham about this and then i start then this fear start to multiply bbbb aud aud laughter walt you know what i mean aud yeah waltshout then i do   not wan na talk shout right then then i go and talk oh he   be gon na say this and he   be gon na say that and he   be gon na be in my face and da na da na da na da na and i   be like and then i go and i talk to him i muster up which be m our second point which be courage audamen manymurmur walti muster up the courage and i talk to windham and you know what i   be like wow that be   not anything like i think manymurmur waltis   not that true manymurmuragreement waltand i feel so much well i   be like i ca   not believe i do that what a dummy what a fool walt that i would think those thing see because a lot of time our fear really be imaginary see fear really involve the misuse of our imagination aud yeah that   be right aud mm walt you know when you   be talk about be a disciple and you hear these incredibly hard sermon and i do preach a few hard sermon manyaman walttoday   be not one of those real hard one aud no walt i think i   would give you a break manylaughter aud thank bro waltmaybe i need a break manylaughter walti   have have a few this week but really it   be true i mean we we and you hear these a incredibly hard sermon a fa well what do they mean about this and what do they mean about that oh ho ha oh ha af manylaughter walti mean i do that i use to hear kip preach in the opera house aud woohoo walt and i   would be like f oh who be this man oh i ca   not believe he say that f manylaughter walt and i   would go there even before we even get there i   would be share we   would go we   would be with laurie and i   would invite someone to come to church with me and they would come and i   would say boy i hope he do   not preach this and i hope he do   not preach that and many laughter walt i hope he do   not say this and i hope he do   not say that manylaughter waltyou ever feel that way manymurmuragreement waltsee and we all of a sudden the fear start bbbb many laughter walt you know what i mean and it totally our imagination run wild manymurmur walt see um fear be really the misuse of our imagination manymurmur waltto focus on the negative audwow walt as oppose to the positive you could use that imagination in a great positive way to give you courage p and that   be really my second point to overcome fear we really need to be able to have courage look it at first john chapter four actually i do i do   not wan na leave this first point till i make this this point within the point randy you know it   be it be really pretty straightforward this morning lance randy and y z i think you do a good job all the way through i mean you be on top of what you be scan lance hm thank randy um lance should   have keep that one horizon fauker jet just t keep em on the right randy why do you switch em lance well look at something i would get it do   not seem like i could get someone else out but um and part of it to provide a good service but then randy yeah well that that i guess that   be one reason the two eight   be kind of well two eight   be kinda nice sometimes because i mean when we   be on ten all the departure seem like they   be go out the left lance randy so you really want your arrival on the right when you   be land two eight then you can get departure off of almost both at any time lance randyso you always get a hole lance nyeah yeah randy so but uh do   not feel bad about keep horizon on the right boy because lancemhm randy sure do   not hurt them to taxi any they   be so used to have a number one service lance yeah plus when they   be departingg randy every one of em come lance they   be right by the gate everyone even even one or one or two of em i say i   will advise if the left become available and they say w randy and they they still ask lance we   would like the left if it become available randy i know they still ask lance randyand viking be the same way lance yeah randy so there   be sh there   be sure nothing wrong with keep em on the right though um traffic watch eight we discuss lance so radar service terminate randy um call me inbound or randy you wan na say radar service terminate frequency change approve report back inbound q or i i think that something a little ttle more like that   be well than just say radar service terminate because he   be kinda lance randy leave hang lance okay randy and you could just say radar service terminate report back inbound and then he   will he   will either come back and say well i   be depart the area now back to hillsborrow or i   will call you back inbound so that give you an idea lance okay randy but uh and uh along with that let tc do more of the work for you lance okay randy you know um just tell her what you want her to do lance randy i be think of a couple instance where you could   have use her more than you do lance okay i be think that for my rundown you know that would that   be that would have be a help but on the other s the other hand bill i wan na get it on tape heck of a job lance randy lanceoh thank you very much do you hear that um randy the problem with do rundown be that it   be kind of over in your face lance yeah yeah so randycause the d light   be kind of pretty far over to the left there but sh you can you can have her do it if you want lance um i would i   am just work at do as much of these other thing as i possibly can because they   will be time when i wo   not have a tc and just just challenge myself randy and that   be okay lance um what be some of the thing other than what what be some of the thing that that i should have use her for that i do   not randy depend on who your lance randywho your tc be if c certain people sit down there they d they have a tendency to do everything for you and sometimes that be p that be really pretty nice if you just if you just all you have to do be stand up and look out the window and look at the bright and talk you no other w no other coordination or or art function or anything that really be nice lance that   be ideal randy it it really help lance mhm randy the situation lance mhm randy so but right now like you say maybe it be well for you to do some of that stuff lance um i do   not think there be i mean i have just a couple that i switch to the left you know maybe three or so that i switch to the left uh p uh probably two or three and so there be that i do   not have any art entry i have you know traffic watch to slue out to randyyawn lanceum randyyawn yeah lancefor the most part i mean i be able to k i think i be able to keep up with that stuff randywith the art lance yeah i mean there be   not really nothing much to do um randyno there be   not lance so randy but there could be lance yeah randyif there   be vfrs departing or lance yeah i tell her to do my vfr guy randy h yeah lanceand um to write down my vfr that   be one thing i get ta kick myself to do randy yeah lance now be we still require to w write like the empire that come in through the gate vfr do   not they we be randy any vfr lance h now be   not that be   not they when they c but what if they   have c well i guess we have no way of know if they   have come in ifr and then cancel vfr randy well yeah because they have a strip on it downstairs lance mhm randyso i do   not actually i   be like you i do   not really know what the point be of that because we do have a record of em anyway but lance mhm randy when the when the order come across or whatever or this memorandum that say to write down all vfr arrival lance okay randy so if they   be a vfr arrival you   be suppose to write it down lance okay i   will do that then p randyunhunh when horizon one thirty eight do   not answer you there lance go back to ground randy yeah lance or just move on to something else randy i mean you try him a couple time you say horizon one thirty eight if they do   not get the hint if he   be but if you ca   not get him just go on and do something else that you can do united be call ready to go lance yeah randyso shoot just let united go horizon lance yeah randyyou ca   not do nothing with him so just have him hold there so just go on to the next lance okay randy next thing and do tell ground he might be still on ground frequency which be lance randy uh usually not too likely because you know lance at that point randyat that point well he   be out there lanceyou know he   be randyand he   be probably sit there lance randyand th he   be not hear anything from the tower you know lance yeah randyhe   be probably look at his radio about then lance yeah i think i be a little bit rigid in my planning of that cause i want to have to plan to get him out at that point and i should   have be more flexible and randy but uh you know h everything else i see you your separation be be really good this morning i mean you really tighten em up maybe a couple time almost a little bit too tight lance a little to tight snort randy cause uh i do   not know y a couple time you have like one just barely at departure end a jet at departure and you clear another jet for takeoff and it work out great lance oh one guy out the right and then oh th both guy out the left randy both guy out to the left lance randy and it work out good but i think it work out because this guy be real slow on on start his departure roll you know lancemhm randyusually you get ta get em just a little bit off the departure end before you clear the next guy and watch out for the uh the seven thirty seven four hundred lance four hundred okay randy or three hundred and lanceokay randy because uh they   will really climb and they can go fast too lance okay randy so well you know just take into consideration the type of aircraft it take the seven twenty seven a little b while to get wind up while the seven thirty seven   will really go but uh i mean it be really good good departure separation lance thank randy i be impressed and you see a little bit about the two sixty head listen to the readback for lance yeah randy if i know he   be at two thirty but you can wrap em around to one thirty or one sixty to avoid the mba and that work great because otherwise you get two sixty there be that one time you have two south plan aircraft and one westbound or river metro and lancemhm randy lancemhm randy i d i actually do   not think you be gon na have three mile between the two first lance mhm randysouth plan air lane but you do that be perfect lance the one that i keep on runway head for a bit randy yeah lanceor randy yeah lance okay randy and that be good it be real good planning to keep that one caravan on runway heading when you have the other one go two sixty to ensure that you have oh and you have the one go two forty lance randy or something lance randyand then you have the metro go s go two sixty lance yeah randy but you keep the metro on this runway heading which be really good planning so lance i   be i   be less and less impact for lack of a well word by these g for some reason with all these um i think the bulk of my planning seem to revolve around these little guy when i can turn em fit em in with all my other guy for some reason i mean y and that be you know those guy have a very fec affective part in the whole fan of all our departure and um randy hm lance i think they   be they   be a affect me less than they do in the past randy yeah lance do that make sense randyyeah lance do you know what i mean um cause i there be a time where i mean that sequence be good too but there be a time when yeah an it it may happen again randy yeah lance who know where i   have get the little west coast in here and all these guy off the right and leave where be i actually gon na fit these guy in and they   be all call they   be ready way early and randy well the sequence uh ca   not be too bad when you get when you can feed from charley lance randy and from bravo and from alpha you know the sequence ca   not be too bad i mean all he do lance you get something you can do randyyeah all he do be send em all out i mean you get all the west coast in the row over on charley lance randyyou get the jet in a row on bravo and you get n various thing over here so you can pick and choose you know y i mean as a ground control you can just send em all out there and then when they get there then you can start arrange the strip lance randyyou know the way you want almost lanceyeah randy you know th that   be lanceyeah randythat it work great that way lance because you do   not have to sequence em at some other point in their taxi route you know randyyeah lance they   be b they e essentially on their own taxiway up through up to the approach end so randy yawn so that be about all that i you know that i have i mean i be pay pretty close attention there and i do   not really see much of a problem lance oh thanks randyno significant problem to talk about lance i   be glad randy see there be s oh um do   not always um do   not insist on always say seven hundred if you say lance oh randy why have   not you lanceat some point after he be leave seven just wait till he be leave seven hundred you mean randysometime you can do that lance yeah randyyeah there be a couple time you do   not need to say it when when you do lanceit be out in the yeah randyyeah well i mean y w lance could   have either wait just a bit randyit be at he be at a five hundred climb and lanceor he be a randy just go ahead and say turn leave head one six zero okay randy or turn leave head two six zero for a metro i mean if you leave em on runway head for a little bit lancemhm randythey   be gon na be at the altitude you need so but that   be no big deal and uh i be watch jet speed come in and you get delta out in front of jet speed lance mhm randy it seem like you be a little tense with that but really pay attention to the speed when they   be come in he be do a hundred and twenty outside of laker there do you see that lanceyeah randy yeah lance so that that work out great randy i wonder if you   would see yeah i mean there be lot of room lot of time lance mhm randyhe be   not he z be   not fly as a normal lancemhm randy for some reason he just use the lancemhm randyor be it uh exec jet one of those guy be usually really fast lance jet speed be th i know fast on the pr departure randy am flight lanceit seem randy yeah lance i think it seem like that be the one but yeah be flight when they fly the later jet um yeah and i think i might have say for delta niner or to no delay or something like that and randy yeah i think you do lance and he be actually float at the jet speed be   not yeah randyyeah you have a lot of time lanceyeah randy when the twin get airborne you get a jet follow the twin twin   be gon na go southwestbound if you get six thousand foot and the twin   be climb out of four or five hundred you can start your transmission then to the to the jet lance okay randytwin cesna ahead be will be turn southwestbound momentarily runway two eight leave clear for takeoff q it say in sight lance just do   not wan na be sure he get his turn in randy mhm lance okay randythe caravan   be come across if you wan na get lance yeah what do you say cause i   have hear different phraseology and i af feel like i be stumble over that i think i say it couple different way randy a mile west or something i   will i just say you know on a day like this it   be so easy to see em i would just say the caravan ahead be southwestbound runway two eight leave clear for takeoff q and and they   will a lot of time they   will say uh in sight if they do   not say in sight they   will say they   will i would assume they have em in sight because they wo   not go lance mhm randyunless they seem em i mean that   be important to them to see the traffic but it   be safe it   be a safe operation because ne thing you could do be be turn the caravan to two forty lance mhm randyto get him across and then just before you ship em send em back to two fifty something like that lance hm randy cause the track   be what i be what   be important but but two fifty be work out fine today fifteen degree and a mile be what you need so or less use visual lance yeah in fact it be a be the west coast that be it the horizon who say he could do the visual with the twin cesna ahead or be it vice versa one of the two env phonere randyyeah lanceand at that point i say do   not need it now they get it randy somebody in there lancei think laura go in there yeah bill comm line for you have a call on the other line randy this be randy okay mbye evelynanother thing i think be interesting be the this uh the emphasis on transportation do you remember the automobile this be the beginning of the uh change linda mhm patty p evelyn evelyn uh train and uh patty carriage evelyn automobiles linda unhunh evelyn and uh hm patty i think margaret though linda mhm pattyi i do   not think we can underestimate her i mean i think she   be a like a lot of woman that i have know i mean she   be in control patty there be no doubt i mean henry wilcox may think he   be in control but he be   not hm patty and there would never be a jacky bast patty while she be uh the head of of that h household whereas i think missis wilc the first missis wilcox ruth lindamhm patty be so other worldly and everything else lindamhm pattyshe do   not even have a clue as to what be go on mhm patty so i feel that that uh margaret be janice patty be and i think for this time she be tremendously uh just in charge lindashe   be very practical pattyyeah dianemhm patty and she do   not care the to b to she do   not care about emancipation lindamhm pattyi mean lindamhm patty she be linda mhm patty so she when you really be already that way you do   not have to make a big to do about it evelynmhm lindamhm mhm diane but she also loisi think also in the movie she have a very strong personality a lot of charisma lindamhm lois and very positive deborah do you see the movie diane diane hm m loiswhich be also what you   be say but lindamhm lois but she just radiate something which be personality lindamhm evelyn you know a funny there be two young people that i have talk to about the movie and i have   not see it but one of them uh be my niece and i say something about margaret talk about her feeling that she be the i think i use the word heroine and she say heroine q and she could   not see margaret as a heroine i think margaret evelynand then she go on to explain she say maybe she be too strong uh we   be use to see someone as the uh you know the protagonist or the the woman on the screen as a romantic as uh all of that and i i have   not see the movie but that be her feeling about it hm lindahunh sue have she read the book also you evelynno no sue t linda just the evelynno suebecause evelyn go to movie sueokay diane evelynand an sue be because the other thing about margaret that would be uh a heroine be that she linda throat sue marrie henry even though all this have happen and then she she stick with henry evelyn mhm sue even though all you know linda cough evelynmhm suethe son end up kill linda cough sueyou know linda sueall this happen and she stick it out with henry linda evelyn yeah sue and that maybe young people nowadays would   not have do evelyn linda suethey would   not have think that heroic they would have think that march out and say i wo   not stay you know or evelyn mhm sue i wo   not marry you or linda suewhatever evelynmm linda i i want to know excuse me i want to know what you think about why she agree to marry him to begin with because although i understand the reason that be give in the book i still could   not quite decide that that   be something she would have decide to do evelyn uh but i n i know what you mean the only thing i be think maybe she be old her chance be you know it be change lindamm evelyn and uh because she be very pleased when he ask her janice ha linda and she admire him accord to the b evelyn mm janice well i do   not think henry be the horrible person that linda but janice uh a lot of critic feel that he be i think maybe forster want him to be that way and i just do   not look at it that way linda mhm janicewhen i read about him but i think he have a lot of good quality lindadid you see some charm there janice mhm sue hm linda okay janicemhm lindahm this be for the movie she evidently do uhuh janice mhm lori well the book she keep say he be charming diane mhm janicewell i read the book too lori i mean he janiceand i lori he r he uh she describe him as a charming evelyn mhm lori when she be talk about him to somebody helen or th in her thought or something margaret say you know he i mean mister wilcox be a charming man evelyn hm linda yeah janice hm well as long as thing be go his way linda i guess i could   not see any charm either place diane lindaand and i i guess that   be what keep kinda s bring me up short on diane linda believe this marriage evelyn after all or and the time too linda you know nineteen ten dianemhm evelyn there be   not a great deal of opportunity for a uh diane i be gon na say do   not she think she really have to be marry evelyn i do   not know janice evelynbut she janicdwell the linda i do   not know janicethe thing i do   not understand be linda i do   not know janicewhy both family be so against paul and helen lori and then the rest of em janice and yen then hen henry and margaret get marry and there do   not seem to be any dissension there linda well the her janiceyou know lindahis kid do   not like that janiceno his kid do   not like it but henry be against but suebut the evelyn well paul have no future suebut the yeah but that be evelyn yhe have no money linda paul have   not make his money um evelynor anything and uh linda yeah janicei think it be mainly because of the difference in the family noracough cough janicethough that they perhaps i misunderstood that linda i do   not know suei linda i do   not know that either suei i agree more with linda that that i think it be a situation where paul could   not marry anybody linda suebecause he have to go overseas janice he do   not have any money sueand make his f you know make his way in the world cause he could   not support a woman janice mhm sue and and maybe those family see rather than the bast who would get marry whether they could support somebody or not they strongly feel that you have to have a certain amount of money or or a certain future in order to end up lori position sueyeah position in order to have a wife lori ready to go linda mm do helen not have enough money to support them i wonder manymurmuragreement linda why could   not helen have just support them suewell i think that that be lori that be   not suethey they would   not have allow that linda that   be not a lorithe wilcoxe would   not have sue that would   not have be alright lorilook at missis wilcox sue accord to the wilcoxe evelyn the the the their code of honor remember the uh sueyeah evelyn strong english honor that they uh that charles have to defend patty man would take care of them evelyn you know pattyright kim dianeexcept in out of africa kim when uh margaret uh when margaret marry uh mister wilcox dianewhich be about the same time linda mhm patty mhm kim what uh do uh it seem to me in the movie they be look at this big house interior of this big house do they move to a big house

pregnant and she   be away somewhere patty tibby be go suebecause she be   not evelyn yeah sue she   be hide janicecough i see sueessentially diane loisis   not it also basically a woman   be the woman be much more develop character than the man janice cough cough lois and the man tend to be lindamhm loisnot such good people linda yeah i think so kim be   not that interesting patty weak kim an that he would write that way if he be a homosexual diane except he be raise by his mother lois i do   not know that everybody agree with that dianeand lois but diane aunt and so on lori yeah so the the mo kim pardon lorithe mother have always be uh woman figure in his life be so strong obviously evelyn mhm kim bu but but the fellow lori be   not that what you   be say kimtibby be be be   not that be name he but he be such a wimpy h nancymhm sure kimphysically weak uh person uh evelyn they all have asthma lori i would   not know who they always hm evelynand uh lori and paul be   not evelyneven live on the farm they all have uh lori hm even charles be   not patty diane evelyn what be it hay fever or asthma or something lindayes pattydiane start to say something about out of africa linda yes dianewell you   be talk about the woman have the money and why th m a man could   not linda mhm mhm lori marry her diane marry the linda mhm dianey yeah in out of africa i think be about this same time period or may well maybe it   be s second world war but isak dinesen lori later dianethe heroine of out of africa be danish but she   be the one with money and she end up a the brother of the person that she   be in love with marrie her linda yeah yeah dianebecause he have no money no family money but she have money h and she have no way to get a husband so they agree to get married because he will then have access to her money and title and she   will have a husband so it be do my point of all that be dianethat it be sometimes do that a woman of mean marry a man of no means as uh an arrangement for what ever reason linda yeah i diane and so it could have be that this linda i guess dianethat her money could have be the s source of marriage if they   would want it to be lindathat   be to me uh uh kind of a m not take care of very well in the book i i guess i do   not know why they do   not diane yeah lindawhy that be such a no no dianeand i do   not realize forster grow up with money that sort of mixed me all up now too because linda mhm dianeit sound to me like he have   not and linda mhm diane yeah i have a question about england in nineteen ten too which show

word of it many linda absolutely oh i think there be a lot of feel a lot of feel diane be this novel popular when it be publish evelyn uh accord to the professor sue lori evelyn that it be a classic of change it be w uh one of the uh classic novel that have to do with change lindabut do the people like it janice tradition and change linda when they read it back then evelyn i would imagine that he

and so because i be have trouble get start i get hang up loriand it do   not make any difference but when you be read the review you talk about the affair between helen and paul do i get the right

evelynm lindait   be a good way to do it lori you know i   be get more into the character pattywell evelynmhm pattyone time in this group lori diane patty and i think it be i do   not remember if it be evelyn or deborah but it be probably it be one of those people who be so knowledgeable diane pattyit be   not be evelyn oh pattycertainly be   not any of us lorimight have be nora evelyncome on tell me about it many laughter patty he he talk they talk about what make a classic linda oh patty and they have several criterion lori oh pattyand i   have forget some of them linda oh pattybut the one i can think of be that it have to be able to be read on many level linda yeah pattyand i think that this be one of those book linda this one do pattythat you can read as just a story about these people who be want to to live at this howard   be end or you can read it as the clash between the intellectual and the practical or between england and germany which be really what they   be get down to be the basis of thata linda mhm mhm lori that be something evelynmhm pattyit can be read at any time it can ap ply to england in nineteen ten or it can apply to america in nineteen ninety three with how far be we go to go with entitlement diane patty how much be we go to take from the uh so call really wealthy who   be the only people that   be go to be touch by this budget manylaughter linda yeah how nice pattyand all of these thing and give to these poor dianeyou forg linda patty i mean even the x dianeyou forget the corporate income tax which be go up and up and up and up and up and if somebody say entitlement one more time i   be gon na scream patty okay i wo   not say that dianewhy be these entitlement patty i wo   not say that dianewhy be you entitled to this kimthe corporate income tax be go to be raise one percent diane linda a kim and so therefore the g big corporation in the us be back this budget change in washington patty well at any rate i think there   be diane pattythat be as linda pattyas typical today i mean as topical today as it be then and then it have to deal with the big question uh the of moral value and of w how you uh perceive the world linda mhm pattyand all of this with it and i there be some other and i ca   not even remember what they all be but i diane i know but it be evelyn who do it and we ought to make her get her note out again because sh pattyyes pattyif you can find this loisshe probably remember manylaughter janice uh evelyn evelyn i do   not remember janicewill you do that again sometime evelyn oh janice evelyni will remember i just i just ca   not remember what it be pattybut i think there be five and i   have only come up with four linda hm nora i think she have five linda oh i only hear three what be the nora let   be patty the well the eternal truth at any time on any level linda oh eternal truth patty yeah lindai miss the eternal truth patty at any time on any level and by any age lori mhm evelyn uh well you do   not mention one thing i think it be very interesting and i think you all w i who be married would have pick up on it the relation between a man and a woman i think there be one phrase in there the crystal what be it the crystal uh shield that come down after a couple be married patty oh evelyn and i have realize that patty evelynso many time with friend linda hm evelynwith whom i be very very intimate you know and yet when they be marry many hm evelyn there be a conjugal linda mhm evelyn oneness that be uh something that i be never able to penetrate nora stood pattymhm linda mhm diane mhm lois hm evelyn and i think that be an interesting phrase lindamhm evelyn i also think it be very interesting her relation with her husband linda mhm evelynwhy she marry him i do   not know but nora evelyn she be able to see the good in any as well as the bad linda mhm diane lindahm evelynand to live with it sueand continue to linda yeah suesort of push at the bad kim you know um sueand try to improve him linda she keep see evelyn mhm diane maybe it   be because she do it with open eye linda mhm yeah kim in the movie you see her look out her window patty kim across the street into the wilson ' apartment and they seem to be a happy very happy congenial family they seem to have a lot of interaction go on in that family lindamhm kimi do   not know linda it   be kimmaybe there be something lindathat   be true kim by the fact that she she see uh a happy family they talk and communicate and laugh and have a good association with each other as she peek out her window look at this uh family linda that   be a good point pattywell and i think lindayeah lori but lindai think so patty ruth miss the first missis wilcox think highly of her husband and margaret think highly of her

not know how to play it jennifer oh okay i   will teach you dan pass disable that   be you jenniferqueen of sp dan jennifer irst lead rotates dan jenniferfirst yeah dan jennifer always pass leave dan jennifer alright so this be us dan groucho harpo jennifer the object okay every heart okay every heart be one point dan be tr jenniferthe q queen of spades be thirteen point the object be not to have any point and you play follow suit and you can take if you take trick th the high card of the suit take the trick if you do   not have the card of the suit you throw whatever you want dan okay so h heart and the queen of spades jenniferare bad dan be the only thing jenniferthat be danthat that have point jenniferthat be point right so if you dan so jenniferif you throw look okay dany jennifer danso we get like three point right here right jennifer we have three point in our hand exactly danand we w wan na try to get rid of that jennifer nright but we   be pass now the first thing you do be you pass three card to your left now these be low heart so i can i   am not gon na pass those i   be gon na pass the f four of club dan all the y right why be that jennifer and these be two high why just because and cause you should always pass a club so that the person so that the first hand y everyone have a club so that they ca   not discard a heart cause you always assume that everyone   be t no one be void of a suit the first time around so you do   not have to worry about throw a high card dan yeah yeah jennifer and then i   be gon na throw two high card so i do   not take those trick because dan but what difference do it make if you take a trick jennifer well because danthey   be not worth anything jennifer cause if i t if i take a tr the k diamond trick and somebody do   not have diamond and they throw a heart into that pile i be gon na take that with that ace so if i throw an ace of diamond and somebody do   not have any diamond they   be gon na throw a heart on me and i   be gon na have to take that trick dan okay but but if they play heart that do   not that do   not win anything i jennifer if they play h dannokay just go ahead and play jenniferokay alright so i   be pass three sthree card and i get dan jenniferthe seven of heart three of heart and the king of f spade begin play the two of club always lead i   be gon na throw the ace of club assume i   be gon na take this trick dan okay okay jennifer no one have to danand then and everybody jenniferright danso it   be kinda risky play the king since jenniferbut i   be gon na assume everyone have club still dan okay alright jenniferokay cause there be thirteen card i   be assume it   be an equal deal now there be eight club out that mean there be only four more left danso you do   not y so you wan na play jennifer so i   be gon na dan a high d high diamond jennifer yeah exactly like a high diamond so jack of diamond okay take with danokay so he take that jenniferokay now the spade danso now jennifernow this be a tricky one now if i have a high spade now i   would throw it because i could take this trick and the h my high spade would be out now i do   not ever wan na take the queen of spades high spade be dangerous because you might queen of spades be a hard cr card to get rid of dan so if yeah okay i see jennifernow i do   not have oh i do have a spade dan well you   be in a good position now because you   have see what everybody else have play jennifer right that   be why diamond dan so you have to play a diamond jennifer now h danright jenniferright and there have be no diamond have there be a diamond trick there   be be one diamond trick danuh y yeah jenniferw only one though danyeah jenniferright danyeah jennifer okay dan yeah you play your ace jenniferokay now it be lead the spade be lead but there   be a heart in this trick so i wan na get under the seven jennifer because i do   not wan na take this trick because there   be a heart danokay jennifer but that   be easy cause i only have two spade dan jenniferand they   be both under seven dan so you would have take that jenniferif i have a eight dan so now you can still get under that jennifer i could still get under so alright dantoo he   be get an eight so you jennifer now listen okay now b two different people take heart now if you t have all if you take all the point if you take all the point all thirteen heart and the queen of diamond dan so that   be twenty six point jennifer it   be call right it   be call shoot the moon and you get you give everyone else twenty six point or else you   be minus twenty six point and that   be good shoot the moon be really hard to do now look it i do   not have a club dan so you can throw a heart jenniferthere you go dan a high heart okay jennifer i do   not have a club now somebody else do take heart right or do he or be i mistake i think ev someone else do take heart i think somebody else do take heart danqueen of spade gon na have to come up m n jenniferthere danthere it be jenniferhe lead i would he just shoot the moon i think someone else take no ch yeah so he get groucho get one heart dan one jenniferand chico get twenty five danso he   be b kinda bum right now jennifer so he suck right dan okay so pass three card so we wan na pass jennifer alright pass so we   be gon na pass the king of spade danking of puppy dog ' foot how come you do   not pass the king of club jennifer i might i do   not have any ace here i   be gon na pass a low heart just so they ca   not shoot the moon i get the ace of heart okay two of club king of clubs ace be out so my queen be the high there alright my jack be the high there dan so you wan na play that now oh jennifer well i   will do it dan so you take that one jennifer yeah dan but that do   not make any difference jennifer right now the two see alright now diamond be a waste alright dan do you just take that jennifer no danthat heart no jenniferno groucho have the uh dan spades be lead jennifer the f danso you play jenniferspade be lead the ace dan take can you play a club if spade be lead and you do   not have jennifer i can yeah i can danbut but if you have heart jenniferyeah dan so you

wh i just get like seven point shit eight alright i have no spade this be a really good hand i have no spade whatsoever it   be really good dan play hearts jennifer i   be gon na try to shoot the moon fosterso erasmus lay the the lay the egg which luther hatch and um when you come then to uh however this debate this freedom of the will um i think uh let me read you a page from brendler because it set the sa stage very nicely this be in the luther book some of you be read and um if you this evening when you go home if you wan na meditate it on more on on it more it   be on page three eleven it   be on page three eleven but let me just read you the cause this give us the set very nicely and then we can uh read erasmus entitle his anti luther pamphlet diatribe concern free will once again the first and fundamental question dispute in fifteen sixteen and fifteen seventeen and again in heidelberg in april of fifteen eighteen with which luther have open the assault on scholastic theology be debate luther be glad to take up the theme of this debate read and this be what luther write to erasmus read you alone among all the other have recognize the key question and you do not bore me with the papacy purgatory indulgence and similar nonsense you and you alone have identify that on which all else hinge and you have put the razor to the throat and for that i thank you heartily um thus luther evalu uh evaluate the subject and erasmus comment on the significance of their engagement in battle in his own style read and he write to luther read perhaps an erasmus who write against you will do more for the gospel than certain dunderhead who support you read and then read humanistic thinking will never consent read this be brendler now obs uh on this uh but this set the stage for what we   be gon na talk about read humanistic thinking will never consent to the doctrine of original sin read pico de la mirandela would not have consent to the doctrine of original sin the author of uh what be it houseman i think of invictus i be the master of my fate i be the captain of my soul q i do   not think that he would acknowledge original sin read be base read uh alright what be it it   be read base as it be on the concept that human nature be totally depraved and of itself not capable of any good will and that apart from grace alone free will be nothing can do nothing do nothing except depraved deed even though these pronouncement be biblically base and may be acceptable within an exclusively theological system they do not appear reconcilable with the dignity of man dignity of man catholic and semi pelagianism with all of it   be emphasis on on the role of prevenient grace finally view free will as the decisive factor in attain salvation thereby conceptualize free will as similar to a healthy man healthy human understanding for how can a person be responsible for his deed if he possess no free will read this be what erasmus ask read how can he decide between good and evil so reason erasmus such argument long know to luther and many time present to him impress him not in the least god alone be salvation god alone measure guilt he alone condemn he alone grant grace justifie and save when he will and whom he will man can do nothing against the divine prerogative man can only accept the divine judgment this be in fact best and if by and and it be by the divine prerogative that man will uh that man be well provide for for god alone be infallible and his being be grace and mercy this concept that man be divinely elect to salvation or to damnation be the center of the predestination dogma that later the geneva reformer calvin make the center of his teaching and that subsequently under other historical precondition and circumstance could be link closely with a prosperous middle class in the netherlands and in england read um uh skip this paragraph this be the paragraph though right here the next one p on page three twelve when you when you read if you wan na read it later read therefore luther do not accept rational argument against predestination doctrine such argument on the contrary necessarily appear to luther give his theological orientation as suspicious from the very start because they originate from human nature which exalt itself against god the whore reason prefer to submit to the devil adjust to all situation and prove everything that be demand of her human nature do not possess free will it be like a horse ride by god or the devil the rider possess the will the horse obey read well that   be as clear as you can get it human nature be like a horse ride by god or the devil the rider possess free will the horse obey alright that thnow the debate be join you see and as you come as erasmus come to this he   be go to say well let   be look at the scripture now number one we have to admit first v first off that there seem to be passage there be passage in the scripture be there not many which seem to teach that man be responsible for his deed and that he may act and have a free will to respond to the invitation of god be   not that clear in the scripture whosoever will may come um jesus turn to his disciple you remember when some desert him and seem because they be disappoint in some of his saying and they be offend by some of the thing he say and they walk no longer with him it say and then he turn to those who remain and he say will ye also go away q they have a choice do   not they will you go away what do you will and the will apparently be re reside in in these disciple and so erasmus be go to say so obviously in scripture we have paradox we have clear passage of scripture which seem to indicate that man have a free will and that he can exercise that will to follow or not to follow to respond or not to respond on the other hand we have passage of scripture which seem to indicate that the will be not free and that the and that man i th be man be predestine by a an omnipotent sovereign will of god we have to take both these pass so it   be not a question of the scriptural authority we both accept the scriptural authority and erasmus in his writing and in his pamphlet the liber arbetrio in his pamphlet the liber arbetrio say to luther qu because it be address to luther you see he say to luther uh i will not church i will not question or i not i will not quote i will not quote the church father to you because i understand you accept no church father authority if it be in disagreement with your opinion so i will quote the only authority that you recognize the holy scripture and so uh exclusively erasmus will appeal to the scripture as his basis when god create adam and eve in the garden he place them in the garden and he say you have a choice uh you have a choice do not eat of the fruit of the knowledge of the good of the tree of good and evil for on the day ye eat thereof ye shall surely die now do not do that and obviously god must have give the first create pair a choice because the whole system of reward or punishment be base upon the decision which be these individual make or when cain slay abel um if you do well shall you not be s sustained but if you do evil sin crouch at the door if you do well apparently from this cain have the ability even after the mur even after the murder of abel he have the ability to make a positive choice accord to erasmus that   be go to be his position well luther um i   will g i   will i   will tell say some of the thing that he he pick first erasmus pick first and um he   be gon na go all through the scripture and he   be gon na take passage like this um return return the prophet say do they not to ancient israel return to the god of the covenant return hosea plead with gomer please come back tyou see and uh this be the symbol of israel come back to the lord come back to the the husband of the covenant come back to the one who call you and summon you it   be the erasmus say the whole premise be that you have a an ability to return that you can make up your mind to change the course that you   be now take and that you can go this way or you can go that way and uh then there be other argument which be uh here   be uh here   be one on um i   will read an excerpt in this uh in this little book this be the um the actual uh wr writing of the s f freedom of the will here   be he he use ecclesiaste god and this be a quote from the b from the book read god make man from the beginning and leave him in the hand of his own counsel he add his commandment and precept if thou would keep the commandment and perform acceptable fidelity forever they shall preserve thee he hath set w he hath set water and fire before thee stretch forth thy hand to which thou wilt before man be life and death good and evil that which he shall choose shall be give him read choose so erasmus   be argument be you have a right to choose you can choose and therefore if you can choose this presuppose that you have a free will in any rate if man be uh if there be a necessity in man   be action if he be predetermine to sin if if god have already determine that this person commit these act then there can be no responsibility on the part of the actor on the part of the perpetrator because how can a person be hold responsible for deed which he do if he mself do not will those the f if in other word he may will those deed but those th those deed be impose upon his will by a transcendent force if that be the case then there be really no freedom of the will and if uh in that case therefore a person can not be responsible for his deed if the deed which he commit have already be eternally foreordain this be uh this be go to be then erasmus   be argument ag on this qu on this question of the freedom of the will but uh uh we   will look at another couple p uh of his passage if here it be read if the will be not free sin could not be attribute to man it cease to be sin if it be not voluntary free will be not extinct though it have contract a paralysis read how be it paralyze well it   be paralyze by the fall see we all participate in the adamic nature and this adamic nature uh when adam in adam remember the new eng new england primer in adam   be fall we sin all q so this adamic nature have be have be pass on to all generation of human and so therefore while we we have a free will it be it be paralyze it   be not the will that be there it   be not the will that uh that adam have because it no longer have the freedom that adam have it be curse by sin it be under the curse of sin so the human will somehow be paralyzed uh erasmus admit that and then erasmus will say that um god then enable what god do and this will be the c really the modern catholic view that god will provide a prevenient grace a prevenient grace that be in other word even though i be unwilling to accept the gift of salvation you see that um that god will give me a prevenient grace which will enable me to move toward this salvation and if i then respond positively to the gift of god then god will extend the exemplary grace to me which enable me to acquire salvation so prevenient grace will put you on the path if you respond on the path then god extend the exemplary grace which will lead you home he use a little story a little uh uh allegory or figure i guess uh there uh there   be a n there   be a tot a toddler uh but he   be get to be big enough to appreciate apple okay because his alright because that   be the that   be part of the story there a nice shiny apple over here over here you see and this little tot he see the apple and he uh he need he want to get to this apple um so he start in the direction of the apple but he   be very unsteady he waver you see and he   be not so what be the prevenient grace the prevenient grace be the adult which do   not take him to the apple do   not lift him up and put him next to the apple b but go along with him just guide him make sure that he he do   not fall he just he let him get there but he just more or less support or sustain the little tot in his motion toward the apple so the little tot you see have decide he want the apple once he see it uh then he he move toward it prevenient grace assist him toward that apple it do   not as i say it do   not carry him there it do   not go get the apple and bring it to him he must go to the apple but he go sustain by this prevenient grace and then if he if he half way to the apple if he decide he do   not want it if he if he see something he th consider more attractive and he go off on a tangent or go off in a different direction then you see then his will have decide that he do not want to cooperate with prevenient grace luther hate that word cooperation w particularly in connection with grace now luther   be position be we be dead in trespass and sin you see there be nothing that can come to us you see now luther come to his reformation remember with this fear of the righteousness of god the righteousness of god and luther all through his monastic life up until around fifteen fifteen be probably when he make that tower discovery that so call l turmerlebnis l the tower experience where read in romans one seventeen he read you know the j the just shall live by faith well you have to take rea really read romans one sixteen first um read i be not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ for it be the power of god onto salvation to everyone that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek for therein read therein it can only refer grammatically to gospel you see read i be not ashamed of the gospel for therein be the righteousness of god reveal as it be write the just shall live by faith read and when he discover this he have read this a hundred time but this one time when he read it he say suddenly it dawn on him what this mean and this place in paul q luther say become for me the gate of paradise q l es ge mir ein licht auf l the light break in on me and what be this light that the righteousness of god be passive righteousness it   be not the righteousness you see luther say i hate that that phrase righteousness of god what do righteousness of god mean righteousness of god mean god be holy and i   be a sinner and i can never stand in his presence and the gulf between us can never be bridge and he   be gon na cast me into hell because of my sin what shall i do to earn the righteousness of god q so you see he be constantly preoccupy with this thought of somehow satisfy the righteousness of god through some work through some indulgence through some prayer sthrough through through renunciation through fast through vigil you know he say if a monk if a m m if ever a monk could   have gain heaven through his monkery it would have be i you see manylaughter foster i mean i mean if ever a monk could   have gain heaven through his monkery it would   have be i aud foster because he d he do everything that he think would would make god respond sympathetically to him and and pacify this righteousness and he be always miserable and then he discover it   be nothing that i do it   be what i accept in faith namely the sacrifice of christ the vicarious sacrifice of christ for my sin on the cross i reach out i accept that as my and and then the righteousness of god be impute to me it   be give to me the the just shall live by faith and so this life in god come to you not ot it   be not god th this l deus absconditus l this conceal god this angry god this god who   be wait to throw you into hell at any minute that that be the image that luther have and now you see and and and work be associate with this his work what do i have to do what do i have to do to placate him what do i have to do to please him and now you see the breakthrough come so luther from his point of view you see he   be come at it from an angle of a of an augustinian monk he   be come at it from that with this travail of soul this agony and anguish of look for this god so he be after this discovery he be go to detest anything in theology which smack of human effort or human work sufficient to please god or to placate god no there be nothing you can do to please god god love you he give you his grace totally out of his grace and nothing from your merit so the human will can not you can not decide to accept god and his grace even the gift of faith it   be interesting in um in bonifas in his book uh now he   be a french huguenot so you would expect it but it   be still it come in an interesting scene where he   be in one of the camp it   be in the second world war he   be in the concentration camp in germany and it   be very b it   be a beautifully write book and and he uh he   be in this scene in this camp and you know you just wan na give up ai mean every day be you   be hang onto life by your fingernail and um he say every day we just live for one day we live one day at a time and then he say it dawn on me that um i i pray i lift up my voice to the lord we pray together and i pray and and he say then it come to me that what sustain me in this situation in this concentration camp what sustain me be my my deep faith in god and then he say and then it dawn on me that this deep faith which i have in god be not my creation well that   be interesting be   not it this faith be give me i do not create it i do not conjure it up it come to me it be give to me that   be the testimony of a huguenot inmate in a concentration camp p well let   be take a break patty i just want to go over the change in the schedule um originally we be go to require the um request for statement of interest and qualification to come back to uh twenty north clark street on april seventh um but the um coordinating council feel that it be wise to give the community more time a weekend two day to uh augment whatever application people be gon na submit aud pattyso the due date be change from april seventh to april eleventh at noon and you can drop off those proposal at twenty north clark street um the same process will continue but for the change in the time at the time that you drop off your proposal you will be schedule for a uh public meeting where you will be give a chance and an opportunity to present your uh proposal um right now we   be look at april fifteenth which be a friday and s and april sixteenth as the uh date for that public presentation and we do   not know where that will be hold or what time that will be hold but we   will make sure that everyone get notice about that during april seventeen to the twenty third the coordinate council will identify the empowerment on location and uh during the week of uh april twenty fifth aud cough pattythere will be a city wide meeting to present the select empowerment zone uh to go over how that zone be select and uh the place date and time for that meeting will also be announce um from may second to june third the strategic plan for the empowerment zone aud cough patty will be develop with the community and during the week of june sixth um a public presentation of on the uh empowerment zone application and the strategic plan will present be present again the place date and time will be announce um and on june thirtieth that   be the drop dead date um when we will send the application for selection by hud as an empowerment zone for chicago um be if there be no other question um we can yes sir grant i have a question patty yeah grant bad case scenario after we submit em the uh the proposal application uh human being be what they be organization be what they be what will the coordinate council what do the city propose to do when there   be a hue and cry from those who attempt to empower themselves and combine with couple with those who be seek more power who say unfair this be   not do right accord to our perspective or this that and the other patty that would be the bad case scenario grant bad case scenario audcough cough grantwhat can the city what what can the coordinate council or what   be gon na be p be in place to listen to all the criticism audcough grant all of the disappointment at not be select so that let   be say optimistically there be some good idea some oversight or something that can be correct hopefully that   be of minor proportion so that we can still keep the city run smoothly and become more and more beautiful patty i do   not know if that issue have be discuss by the um coordinating council i think it   be a legitimate issue um i w y would be willing to take that back to have them discuss that but i mean the bad thing would be for hud not to recognize that this be a c collaborative effort a partnership between the community the city the business community and the neighborhood and i mean it would   not bode well for chicago to get an empowerment zone if if everyone be not supportive and on board so i mean that answer your question i do   not know what the coordinate council   be role in that case would be but we   will definitely take that message back on that question i grant may i propose that the coordinate council consider my individual bad case scenario and any other bad case scenario that they collectively might come up with notwithstanding paul   be suggestion that the empowerment zone money a hundred million cta green line three hundred million be utilize effectively and efficiently to get a big bang for the buck patty kay rise i just want to say that there   be also some other opportunity for um organization that be new in the network process and i think that the more meeting you can attend and the more organization that hear your voice aud rosethe better there   be uh a network meeting go on on friday at nine thirty in the morning at the mega center and it   be free it   be it   be a it   be a group of assist and nonassist agency um organization like crcc the mega center the cobcu woman   be business development center small business development center i could   not even begin to mention the list because there   be about twenty five different assist and nonassist agency on there but i think that anybody who belong to an organization um that have any type of connection with the city it would be good to granttwenty sixth where rise this one be friday at nine thirty at the mega center grant the bank right that   be the bank rise it   be one o five west adams on the seventh floor grant at what time rise nine i   be sorry it   be nine to ten thirty grant okay i i i i have a clue that she give me but i   will make arrangement on it rosemhm patty the lady in the yellow sweater karenactually i be again i be try to reframe his concern in the good case scenario the alderman speak to you feel that somehow the process that have be establish um could divide the city good case scenario would be the provision be make such that the idea that come out and the collaboration that come out of this process and let them continue whether or not the city of chicago be designate for anything that that some reassurance of what come out of it aud karencould be um somehow take into consideration and continue to be foster from the city of chicago patty i think the city be i mean i know the city be commit to that and i know that that have come up at the i um the coordinate council meeting a desire to work continue to work audcough patty with people no matter what happen on this issue and there   be be some discussion about um other kind of fund that could be put towards implement uh uh area plan in area that be not select aud pattyum so i think there be a commitment to do that and that that certainly have be the spirit of the um coordinate council you and then paul danum i   have get uh three question for you uh and i suppose your response be gon na just kinda on there but first um do the city have any idea how many uh request they   be gon na how many proposal that they   be gon na be get do you have an estimation patty no dan so aud at least one dan manylaughter dani   be sure um s aud dan uh well that kind of lead into my my next question i think touch on these people   be question as far as it seem like it would behoove us all if there be some kind of consensus building process before uh this go on and so what people be say they   be have community meeting community organiza community uh group meeting but uh it   be from what i understand of this empowerment zone process the idea be to really involve thing on a g grassroots level aud cough dan and my two concern on par as far as participation go be one that a and i voice this concern with eld jarret when uh last month at the uh washington or uh washington library center when they uh the person introduce that and that be simply throw this out into the community and say that you expect the community to be able to respond community group to be able to respond to you be i think it at l at least not an effective uh instrument for for get this do uh aud cough pattyi think that that   be the expectation of the dan it do   not it do   not address pattyof the dan it do   not address the fact that one community organization um and many be of them be service provider do not necessarily have the same goal in mind as community resident do they   have get different agenda they   have get different priority they   have get different purpose than member of the r the community themselves um the second thing be that people who do not live directly inside the area that be gon na be part of the empowerment zone they   have get an override concern in this because as mr pollack say a hundred million dollar be just gon na be a drop in the bucket to be able to make these thing work and especially to make them work over a ten year process that this be call for there   be gon na be a lot of community resource s uh from the federal government from the state county and city that be gon na need to be marshal they   be gon na need to be reallocate to this area and to be able to have a consensus not just within the empowerment zone but within the city itself if these service be gon na be provide and maintain over the ten year through different administration through different aldermen political process involve these people be not be bring into the decision make process beforehand and i think this speak to these people   be concern that patty these people mean who the dani i hear several people this this r i do   not know their name so i   will just have to woman in yellow gentleman here in the glass that there   be gon na be h uh earlier that very first speaker gentleman uh ed smith uh that you   be gon na be receive a number of proposal and you say you do   not know how many i do   not know how you   be gon na have twenty eight thirty two people that you say on a coordinate council read maybe a hundred proposal within a week   be time and be able to arrive at one select empowerment zone it seem to me that it be much more beneficial if the entire community as a whole be bring into this process and this be what i   be bring up be the idea of participation true community base citizen participation would involve ongoing series of meeting that i would think that the coordinate council would be promote would be organize and direct on an ngoe even nightly basis aud cough cough cough patty that   be not exactly grassroot planning dan to be pattyeither danright patty um grassroot planning be when people get out in the community and organize dan but they need a forum patty and do the work danthey need if this woman here today do not speak up patty and pattylet me answer your question danall these people here would not even know a meeting be go on pattylet me try to respond to your question sir so what you   be suggest be not a grassroot in my opinion a grassroot process secondly the the the reality be we only have till june thirtieth to submit an application a really a true strategic planning process grassroot take many more month than that many more year than we have dan patty okay so we have to do the good that we can do give the time that we have dan and all i   be say be i   be say that i do   not believe a forum be be present for community group to i mean some people be find out about this for the first time tonight some people be find out about meeting that be go on with other group for the first time tonight this be not be promote by the city this be not be publicize as a forum as a patty it have be promote it have be publicize i do   not know dani   will tell you right now that the lead onprofit affordable housing provider on the west side be   not even involved with this he say he have   not even pride have not even be contact by those group on the west side pattywell let me tell you i   have work with pride and i have a meeting with pride last week they know about it dani do   not say they do   not know about it i say they   be not be they   be not be contact by y as far as be bring into a network for this i   be i   be sorry i   be not try to be confrontational okay i   be try to raise issue and concern alright pattyalthough i do think dan the second my second qu pattythat the organization have a responsibility if they   be interested in this dan undoubtedly undoubtedly pattyand they care about empowerment of th of their constituency danundoubtedly pattyto get involve in the process and find a way to make that happen danm my second question would be on the process the city obviously   be get its own priority it   be get um fund already allocate in budget it   be get area designate that they would like to see work on and my question as far as the process be c way the selection go be um what w which be gon na drive which how much weight be gon na be give to um proposal which dovetail into exist program that the city have or that the city be intend on implement in certain area and how much be the city willing to bend and say i will g we be gon na forego these uh schedule or propose project to be able to dovetail into empowerment zone grant what   be be say patty be when be the city go to present say for instance its overall plan for conduct the city so everyone can see their seat in the auditorium or their place around the table and how long will they have to wait for their turn for development when will their interest be serve so this empowerment zone it simply seem to me be open a pandora   be box patty go ahead well to let me answer your question in term of the um uh propose plan i mean right now the um coordinate council be make the selection base on the information that be receive from the community and obviously there there be other issue to look at for example um organization that may be involve in um current work their ability new organization new idea i mean all that be get be throw in the pot and i do   not think that any community that have an exist plan have a leg up on any one else who have a new idea that may not be part of a plan dan uh be they explain the uh for example i do   not know if londa white be here s uh theoretical at a uh a uh community meeting last month in which uh a lot of uh selection criterion be uh draw up i be wonder if be the council gon na absorb that into the selection process also pattythe council have uh receive a copy of that and the council have see portion of uh of the seaway principle some of those principle have be be include in what we have tonight aud cough patty other be really principle for the zone itself and how the makeup of the zone will be and that be go to be hand out to the uh coordinate council this thursday dan uh m m my third question be on the final program i think this gentleman again speak very very adequately to it um it seem to me again this idea of build consensus that if we   be able to make this a program like this work over such a long time that the city and in fact it   be state in the uh uh proposal the uh hud application proposal that the uh govern body make the application must provide a ssurance and evidence that this uh uh empowerment zone plan be gon na be adhere to and implement and it seem to me that one of the most fundawen fundamental and good way to have this do would be for the city to come up with a comprehensive plan aud cough cough dan that follow guideline that would ensure that what   be happen in the empowerment zone be indeed the seed program that   be gon na be follow and be able to be dis distribute to other area of the city and and build on in other area of the city do the city have any uh plan uh any any hope of come up with a comprehensive plan for develop the city patty we do not have a comprehensive plan for the city of chicago dan do the city have patty we have dan any hope of patty policy for development and we have be identify place that have plan and try to get thing do a comprehensive plan require uh the infusion of many many dollar much more than be available you know within the city budget to implement a plan and at this point we be look at way to be strategic in how we invest our money and the empowerment zone be an e be an example of an of an area where we be go to do some strategic planning along with the community which will lead to implementation and invest in our plan dan correct would you say it   be only we only have policy guideline and when when administration change policy change what i   be talk about be that city that we be compete against seattle san antonio minneapolis they   have get comprehensive plan for the development of their city and that pattysome of them do and some of them do not danthe one that i just mention do patty dan alright patty danand my point be patty some of them do danthat pattyand some of them do not dan the one that i just mention do and my my point be that it seem to us that it it it seem to me that it would give us as chicago a much well foot with government if we say that we have a comprehensive plan that be gon na ensure that these thing be go to be patty well sir dan pattyconsidere that our plan be due june thirtieth and consider that between now and then we will not have a comprehensive plan for the city of chicago um i   be not quite sure where to go with your question aud cough cough patty oh i   am s i   be sorry derek oh bernie go ahead go ahead patty bernie berniei ha i just want to make a friendly remind patty i   be sorry derek derekum my name   be derek williams i   be i   be with the horn association of man and uh i i think we need to recognize that uh uh this be an opportunity and it   be not a threat uh consensus do not build themselves and and if we just be perfectly honest with each other the only reason that we   be all in this room be because we hear about a hundred million dollar manylaughter derekand that   be what everybody   be worried about uh it   be impossible for any city to have a comprehensive plan because we do   not have comprehensive people first of all and i think we just need to given the information that   be out there we need to try to make it as meaningful as we can to our constituent uh be honestly speak with you uh i come from an organization with five hundred member and empowerment zone have absolutely no meaning to just about eighty percent of our population for the simple reason we get catch up in in in all of the rhetoric um we we constantly challenge each other and i i do   not think this be the time for that i i think we should be try to focus on the information that   be available and and and meet the challenge and i and i think we can do that and in and again this be an opportunity to meet the challenge many applause patty thank derek that   be why i guess you   be sit in the front row um paul paul derek i i appreciate follow you derek thank paul well see i would   have be kinda frustrate try to say what you say some of it i   would like to just for a couple minute set the record straight on what empowerment zone be and what they be not accord to my own understanding the empowerment zone be implement under the clinton administration they do not start under the clinton administration they start in the state of illinois as enterprise zone back in the eighty the difference between empowerment zone and enterprise zone be that the federal government for twelve year congress never do approve enterprise zone at the federal level by the time they be approve congress in its wisdom attach funding criterion and shift the name from enterprise zone to empowerment zone for the record i do not live in cha i be not homeless i do not transport myself on cta property i   be a veteran so i do not go to county hospital i abide by the law so i   be not in county jail i have attend several college i think successfully they think unsuccessfully so i do not need the public education system in chicago but i do know who doesuz need em the homeless and people not in public housing public housing because one we   be get ready to tear them all down what be we gon na do with it the city have no right would be in a fight we need to try and tell me what my block need when my block decide what it need and present its plan to the city then the city can take its logical legal jurisprudence course of identify what resource it have and make em available the empowerment zone what be by legislation to be plan by with and for those most in need of empower it do   not mention those agency most in need this be not the entitlement program see the entitlement program be what have turn the west side into a damn desert of oasis and poverty because the west side be plan for cha be plan for the city have put together in a aggregate sum the map that be about two page that show you where the poor folk live if you be an agency that be involve in those area take the opportunity to find out what those people need and deliver the proposal if you be an agency that be outside of those area of the census track that each of you have then change your location do like reagan say and move with your foot into the area this be no you know three card molly here we already know where the most empower less people be get busy patty ask a question earlier i have choose not to do it but out of necessity i   be gon na ask you to walk through this this be where the poor folk live this be where your tax dollar be go and this be why you get upset every time the city launch a project because you say it come in over budget this be where the state have road go on this be where county hospital have road go on so as far as i   be concerned if the city do anything more than what it be do i would file a grievance with the department of justice to say that they be in violation of the legislation the legislation say that those who have nothing be either to be court by those who have something or leave alone so that they can develop their own plan and be responsible for their success or their failure that to me be the empowerment zone anything else be a contradiction malcolm we sit in the college name after him he say by whatever mean necessary so by whatever mean necessary it take for you to get gautonomous touched contagious in in love with poor folk be what be gon na take to keep your agency empower many applause patty thank you paul um before we close we have uh several member of the coordinate council here who i   would like to recognize and see if they want to add anything before we leave uh here tonight um we have sproule white who be the executive director of the chicago jobs council um wanda white who be the executive director of the community workshop on economic development aud cough patty and ted wysaki who be the executive director of uh cando the chicago association of neighborhood development organization and also frank grossman be here from continental bank and also the chair of the capital improvement advisory committee do you wan na say anything okay cheryl i   will just make one point and i   will make it brief and that be phil cool alright folk well alreet hx well alroot hx well alright by now i   be sure you   be wonder about the different thing that i have on the table here but first i would like to talk to you about these three item i have here some ice in a pan water in this glass and steam rise from this pot now i would like to ask you how these three thing tell me please how be they all alike these three thing this ice here in this pan this water in this glass and the steam rise from this pot just yell it out we be informal here yes correct they be all form of water this ice here of course be water i tell you there be water in this glass and you have all see water boil at home so you be familiar with steam but now let   be try to figure out how they   be different we   will look at temperature first and the temperature of this water here the ice be about uh twenty four nwoo nineteen degree very cold the temperature of this w water here be sixty four degree the temperature of this steam be i know it   be hot than that yeah it   be about a hundred and eleven degree okay fahrenheit okay oh and by the way guy what do we call something that   be hard like this ice here or a table or a rock we call it a many solid phil very good you should g you should be a choir you should go out on the road there like yeah aud we be phil y oh well i   be glad to meet you please give me your itinerary after the show yes yes of course we call it a sholids a solid and a solid have one shape the shape that it start out with and what do we call something that you that you can splish splash take a bath in anything wet like soda or milk manyliquid philyou   be not gon na let me finish be you yes we call it a aud liquid philvery good and a liquid can change its shape to f completely fill the bottom of whatever container you put it in and finally what do we call something that   be loose and float around like this steam here or a cloud or the air we breathe we call it a manygas phil correct a gas and a gas completely fill whatever shape container you put it in and so how do you get water to change from a solid to a liquid to a gas and back and forth audadd energy phil woo i like the way he express that never before have i hear it add or subtract energy or heat change the temperature basically correct alright well folk now i   be go to show you something else that happen when you change the temperature and that   be where these balloon come in i have here a number of balloon but l let   be see how many of these balloon i can fit into this little itty bitty container here well everybody count together this would be aud there   be a in there phil you think well okay w th th i   be glad i never see d citizen cane with you rosebud be a sled okay well let   be all count together folk that be aud one audone phil very good one balloon go into the little container here and this would be manytwo phil two very good count there two excellent two balloon go into the little container here ah they   be not fitting in so easily oh no so hopefully i can fit all balloon into this little container here aud phil oh stop guess at what this be let   be have some suspense here come on alright and this would be many three phil three very good three balloon go onto the the little container there three balloon three yes the balloon trinity and now this would be audeight aud aud four philfour very good at first he be confused but then he figure it out everybody tell him what this be it   be aud seven phil it   be four boy you people do   not watch enough sesame street as a child this would be many five phil thank you very much yes sing five swollen balloon sing in in down down ah ah okay and this would be many six phil six good and let   be do this uh let   be add some complexity to this here let   be do it in another language in spanish it would be aud l ocho l aud l seis l phil l s seis n ocho l oh my gosh i   be afraid for our nation okay well and this would be aud l siete l phil thank you seven right seven okay and finally this would be aud eight aud l ocho l phileight or l ocho l in spanish and uh l huit l in french thank you very much i think you be tell me your breakfast what you have for b but no l huit l very good oh my gosh eight balloon into this little container here i bet you   be wonder r how that happen aud you pop two aud there   be a hole in it phil well there   be a hole no if you   be think there   be a hole think again because there   be no hole in the counter at all audpull em out audyou slow down the molecule philwell la duh dah dih duh duh you   be get a little ahead of me son let   be all figure it out together aud you pop them phil and we can get a well idea of what   be happen to the balloon if we go back and look at the water again no i do not pop them you   be what y what y do you heckle every scientific person this be really terrible i   be gon na take some of this hot water here and pour it into this flask here and put a balloon over the top of the flask ah alright and now i will heat up this water use my bunsen burner do it use real bunsen be that what you   be ask me alright here we go there we go alright i   be use the fire now to heat up the water but let   be behave like scientist now and watch and observe and take note of what we see okay now folk what do we see well if we look very closely we can see condensation here on the side of this flask and steam rise up from the water go up into the balloon make the balloon blow up woo do   not want too much heat there oh we can also start to see bubble in the water the water that be sit at the bottom of this flask turn into a gas that have enough force to fill up this balloon that   be what we call boiling folk and i   be sure you do too turn from a liquid into a gas now if i take the t balloon if i take the balloon off the top of this flask here and put the water into the freezer what do you think would happen to the water it would freeze and turn into a aud solid phil solid correct but it would still be water yes you   be right whether it   be a solid a liquid or a gas so let   be think about what water be make up of well water be make up of atom yeah everything be make up of atom solid liquid gas now in water two atom of what ato uh element yes aud hydrogen phil very good hydrogen and one atom of what aud oxygen phil oxygen i know you want to say it but he   be my pet okay aud phil a all these atom combine to form a molecule of water and that   be what a molecule be folk a group of atom hang out have a good time together and they call the water molecule aich two o alright so folk how do you suppose the molecule in this water goodbye guy i i   will miss you aud philhow do you suppose the molecule in this water when it   be ice be different from the molecule in the water when it   be a liquid and different still from the water from the molecule in the water when it   be steam aud fast phil do you know yes audthey   be not move phil that   be right it   be th it   be movement my friend you see all molecule move not just in water but in everything in the universe even you the molecule be move but to get a well understanding of how those molecule interact let   be pretend these ping pong ball here be molecule well folk in a solid like this ice here or a table the molecule be move very slowly env machinestart philalright and they   be very close together in fact they   be in a v join uniform state okay they move very coolly slowly and that   be what it   be like in a solid like the ice but in a liquid envmachinelouder phil the molecule be move a little more quickly okay so you have some fluidity of movement within a fix volume okay they   be a little more further apart there but in a gas envmachinelouder phil look at that they   be move very quickly indeed alright they   be move so fast they completely fill the shape container envmachinestop phil that   be what it   be like in a gas and temperature be a measurement of how fast or slow molecule be move so if you have slow move molecule what temperature do you have people yes cold or low temperature and if you have fast move molecule what type of temperature do you have many hot phil hot or high temperature you   be right but not every substance become a solid a liquid and a gas at the same temperature as water do and that bring us back to the mystery of our disappear balloon now inside this container here into which our balloon ah i be lose my sphere inside this container into which our balloon have disappear i have a liquid i   be go to take some of that liquid and examine it much in the same way that i do the water yeah alright guy let   be watch now and see what occur i   be go to pour this liquid into this flask here and again we will behave like scientist and watch and observe and see what we notice now here be a liquid that be bubble and steam like the water be when there be the f when there be a flame underneath it but there   be no flame underneath this liquid here nthat   be different let   be see what happen when i put a balloon over the top if we do in fact have a liquid that   be turn into a gas with enough force to fill up a balloon and lo and behold we do it be fill up the balloon here but this steam here be very cold and we can see that frost be form on the side of this flask here frost my god that   be curious let   be see what the temperature be of this liquid aud manylaughter phildid you guy come from a deprived home or something you do   not have balloon fight over balloon i never think i   would see the day i   be go to put this probe here into this liquid and we will see what temperature this balloon be uh try to stay in your seat i do   not want you guy to run up throughout the show okay now the temperature of this liquid be three hundred and twenty three degree below zero water become a solid at thirty two degree above zero and it remain a solid at every tenjure temperature below that so folk do you think this three hundred and twenty three degree liquid be water many no phil no that   be right go ahead and shake your head in disbelief of course it   be not water no this folk be liquid nitrogen ah yes where folk can you find lot of nitrogen in he   be like oe this i think he have bad breath yes the air you   be breathe right now your lung be fill with this stuff all of you the air be probably about seventy percent nitrogen and uh it   be oxygen and other gas as well okay our body take it all in but we only use the oxygen we breathe out the nitrogen the reason why the nitrogen be not freeze our lung as it be do this flask here be because those molecule be move much faster the nitrogen be warm probably about seventy degree i would imagine but this liquid be very cold indeed three hundred and twenty three degree below zero well to get exactly to get an idea about how cold that be let   be use these two bounce rubber ball i would like you people in the audience to examine the ball to let me know if they be in fact average normal everyday ball testify for the audience do   not bite into it jeesh aud phil you   have really have   not be feed have you oh i   be really feel sorry for you please bounce it back now aud no do   not bounce it phil aud throw it anywhere else phil audthrow it in the water right under the water phil that be i   be surprised i catch that normally i   be ftry to goof i   be like michael jordan in the white sox but anyway but this time i catch it so let   be see what happen when one of these ball go into the liquid nitrogen now the other one stay out here with me where it   be nice and warm well let   be think now about what   be happen to this ball it   be in the very cold liquid nitrogen right so what do you think be happen to the ball be the ball get hot or cold everybody say it out loud audhotter many cold phil colder okay some people do   not agree with you in fact most people do   not yes it   be get cold so if the ball be get cold do you think the ball   be molecule be go faster or slow manyslower phil slower okay and that you all concur that be excellent so if these molecule be go slow do you think and the ball be get cold do you think the ball be become more of a solid or more of a liquid what do you think aud liquid phil a liquid only one person think that cause everybody do   not want to go all that far out on a limb so let   be see if uh sh if what this guy be think be true if it become more of a liquid or more of a solid i will take this ball out of the liquid nitrogen and we will begin the experiment okay now let   be see they look alike do   not they they still look pretty much the same except we have steam come off this ball here let   be see if they bounce as before envballbounce phil well this one m bounce pretty much the same but this one be different that be curious hmm well i must continue my study let   be see how they react under pressure grunt okay grunt alright this one pretty much be absorb my energy it remain intact but let   be see what happen to this ball aud do it break phil no it break you see these molecule get slow and slow and slow and closer together the ball become more of a solid than before it become harder well folk that kinda k it give you a little bit of an idea of what   be happen to our balloon but it still do   not make it absolutely clear so and we   will see what happen to this big old balloon when it interact with liquid nitrogen alright rather than see what happen tha there and guess at what   be happen to these balloon in the container we will see what happen to a balloon when it interact with liquid nitrogen in the light of day alright i   be pour the very cold liquid nitrogen over this balloon so the balloon and its content the air inside be get cold and cold and colder okay those molecule be slow down they   be go slow and slow and so they   be get close and closer together okay you still have the same number of air molecule inside this balloon as you do before it   be just that they   be go slower so they   be close together and they take up less space in this balloon and look at the balloon at the very bottom of it you can see a liquid that   be the air people how often do you get to see liquified air but that be the air the molecule have get so slow down and so close together that they   be less they   be not in the as much in the form of a gas now they   be more in the form of a liquid but now the air around it be cause those molecule to speed up ha ha and so the molecule be speed up they   be get further and further apart and take up more space inside the balloon so the balloon go back to its former size and shape so that have to be what   be happen to the balloon that be inside this container here alright yes these balloon be in the very cold liquid nitrogen and so those molecule slow down and get close together the air take up less space inside the balloon so i can fit all those balloon into this little itty bitty container but now i   be take the balloon out of this container so the molecule be speed up the air be heat up okay and so the molecule be go faster and faster and they   be get further and further apart they   be take up less space inside i   be sorry take up more and more space inside these balloon and you might want to protect your eardrum cause sometimes as these balloon expand they pop and let me tell you i get quite shell shock at the end of the day so this really teach us a lot people this tell us that the difference env pop phil ow the difference in a substance between a solid a liquid and a gas like water be how fast the molecule be move and that different substance become a solid a liquid and a gas at different temperature and temperature be a measurement of how fast or slow molecule be move that   be what i want to tell you people i love to share that with everyone that i meet if you have any question about this or any other subject come on up and ask even if you do   not i certainly hope you have a great day here at the museum of science and industry envpop aud phil oh thank you very much oy someone   be be shoot env ring ring jill hello jeff how   be my favorite girl in the world jill hey baby jeff who   be who   be the girl

you and i do   not for that reason jill uh unhunh aw thanks yeah well the thing be i have   not tell you but my period be really late you know and i guess we would talk and then we   would hang up and then i think oh gosh i forgot to tell you but jeffi   have be mean to ask you about that jillreally you be get nervous jeffyou have   not have it yet jill no i mean and it   be be so long and so it   be like eight day late and i think i   be sure i   be pregnant i   be positive and i be wait till jill get here jeffwh that   be bad wh jill to even try to check jeff oh yeah jill and um so we go to go get an ept at pregnancy test jeff yeah jilland then we d that   be why we be call you last night you know jeffwhat happen jill and then of course it come out fine so that   be the jeff it come out negative jillyeah so that   be the relief and the ecstasy jeff so y you ca   not be pregnant jill no i do   not no unless it be a false negative jeff jillwhich i doubt because jeff that   be rare right jill right i think that would be really rare jeff so th you know what i mean like can would it come out nega let   be say i i f you be pregnant in its early st early early stage jill mhm jefflike wo like would a negative you know what i   be say jill m jefflike could you get be it possible that you could still be posi positive jill i think there   would be a slight chance of it be a false negative but i do   not think so cause i   be pretty late and i think i   be late enough where i would have like enough of the hormone that the pregnancy test test for i think i would have enough of that in my urine that of course it would show up if i have any in there jeff yeah jill you know so i i i   be pret i take that as a pretty good sign jeff oh my god jill you know jeffhoney how come you   have be keep all this inside jill i know i do   not mean to keep it inside jeff jilli mean i do   not mean jeffdo   not you love me jilloh jeffaw jilli do   not mean to not tell you at all it be just we would hang up the phone then i think oh yeah i forgot to mention that i   be kinda late cause i do   not think it be a huge deal but then i guess i be   not try i think i be in a bit of denial like i be   not really think about it much you know cause i know once jill get here then i would go get the test jeff so be that all the drama jill that be the drama and that be the suspense and that be the relief and that be the ecstasy jeff really jillunhunh jeff oh honey jill oh jefflittle bunny be go through the whole wide spectrum of emotion jill jeff jill jeffshe   be do it without me jill jeff she   be go solo on this jilli   be go solo jeffthis be jillpan go solo jill i know jeff jilli think it be so funny last night like what if it come back positive and then that would mean the next time i talk to you i   would be tell you that i be pregnant and then i think gosh poor jeff like i have   not give you any like you know like i have   not warn you or anything and it would have be such a surprise jeff totally jilli think oh my gosh i be even g jeff that would   have be jillgonna bring the camera into the bathroom to take a picture of the ept cause i think jeff jill you know it   be like such a momentous occasion like what if it come out positive jeff jilland then i think of cour like i   be know i would   not have it or anything but i think if the slight chance i would have it and it really become a person someday would   not they love to see the photograph of the ept jeff jillwith the positive sign on it know that that be like its first sign of life

jill really jeff yeah i wave at her and she just keep go jill maybe um if there   be a reflection or something jeff what a body she have jill be   not that incredible be our body gon na do that jeffit   be like it   be like she   be evolve jill jeff you know like it   be funny jill or degenerate no jeffdegener yeah it   be kinda weird jill jeffhunh jill yeah jeff the whole cycle of life what a fucking trip jill i know jeff oh but di i d i know you would you get excited about thing like this too but do you read in the paper about the um planet cir circulate around other star jillno what about them jeff there   be irr irreb irre there   be proof what   be the what   be the word that go before proof jill irrefutable jeffirrefutable proof jill what   be the word that go before proof jeff there thank you honey that be so good jill jeffwhat a good team we be jill jeff i could just see myself like lecture to a bunch of people and like oh honey by the way what   be that word that jill that go before honor jeff irrefutable jeff i   be like jill jeffoh yes yes yes thank you very much what would i be without her q jill jeff jill jeff um would   not that be funny jill yeah jeffaw honey would   not that be funny jill that would be jeff like if someone be lecture and they say they look at you jill jeffthey say be my wife here q mwell jill jeffand then she raise her hand jill jeff oh honey what wor be we talk about the other night jill what   be that word i   be look for honey jeffyou know when q jill you know what i   be talk about q jeff i would   not the whole place just laugh jill yeah i think it   be so funny jeff okay anyway can i run this by you really quick jill unhunh jeff there   be this scientist that come up with irrefutable proof that there be there they find two planet circulate around a sun or a star in the universe outside of our solar system jill brwi really wibr jeff and so which like make me think you know like you know like how we have always talk about life be out there you know jill unhunh jefflike there have to be cause there   be planet evolve around um jillunhunh jeff you know various star and stuff just like ours jillunhunh jeff and but see i never know that that be just a theory you know an a theory that there be planet go around other star jillyou mean you actually think that we have see this before jeff no no actually tha i i no i do   not i just i just think that it be like pretty much factual jill oh yeah jeff jillnot at all jeff so you know so it   be kind of like a leap of faith you know that we have always think that jill m jeff you know i mean like like the scientist who who do it ca   not really prove it like they they make this leap of faith you know they just assume right that there w there be planet jill mhm jeff around other suns right jill right just by the sheer number they think well what be the chance you know f we have billion and million of star then chance be you know even if it take like one in a million chance for there to be another planetary system well like we have million and million and billion of opportunity to have that happen jeff unhunh jill so i think that   be the whole thing like carl sagan would always go yeah billion and billion q like he would say that jeff unhunh jilli think he would say that but yeah so anyhow like w in what galaxy like what solar like what what galaxy be this star in jeff santa barbara jill jeffno i   be not sure jill jeffi do   not know the the detail but jill jeffanyway what it make me think about be jill jeff the fact that you know how you always this might sound a little silly jillm jeff but you know how like you like i i i   be very passionate about certain idea jill jeffyou know jillreally jefflike jill jeff you know what i mean jill yes jeffhow and then you   be like more scientific or you   be more you know open to other possibility jill unhunh jeff you know like in like you know like you   be ch um just even with people but with the ide like you would like you would ask like how do you know for sure you know jill m jeff and it   be like you know like the oh i do   not know where be i go with this p jill that and now here it be here be the factual proof and so i can be satisfied jeffthat yeah well just to show you that you know like you can make an assumption and you can assume something that feel you know really correct and and it turn out to be that way jill sure some of the time jeffgasp uh yeah jill i feel like well if you also feel that i do   not know you could feel something that would   not be prove right jeff yeah jill but no but i think that   be so exciting honey jeffno it   be okay honey jill i do   not see that in the newspaper jeff it   be okay sweetie jill oh jeff i do it be more exciting when i be think about it the other night jillno it   be so exciting i mean i i   am s jeff no my whole idea about jill i mean it   be so exciting that i d like do   not even believe you like i think it   be that exciting jeff oh my god jill i mean like i feel like it   be jeffyou do   not believe me jillno it   be so exciting that i feel like jeff that   be jilli want to go read it in the newspaper for myself like i ca   not believe it like how come it   be not on the news jeff jilland jeff i know jillthere be   not like party now jeff jill jeffand they even u they   have be study the two planet jill mhm jeffand their pattern and how they like s jill jeffum they they circle the the their star jillunhunh jeffand they think that there   be not it ca   not those planet ca   not sustain life jill oh just from the distance from it jeff no from um like from their surface the the planet   be surface jill oh they can see that jeff well th t   be weird they get it from like they pick up heat wave jilloh jeffyou know and it   be it   be just obviously they ca   not se really see anything jill jeff they the only way they could tell that the planet be out there like they can tell like the star be be out there be just by radio wave and and how you know what jill god that   be so incredible jeffand heat wave i t i it   be unbelievable how man have you know like jill from this little point jeff jill in the whole universe like we   have be able to tell so much just with science jeff i know be   not it wild jill just with aw that   be so incredible jeff that send me out there jill wow jeff jill totally oh wow that   be so exciting jeffoh honey you   be not pregnant jill no i   am s jeff y you be convince you be pregnant jill well i only get convince the moment before i be wait for the result like all before that well i   be late but i do   not feel any of the symptom but i get so nervous right when i be take the test i be kind of not treat it take it that seriously cause it   be just it   be such an un believable concept to think that maybe i would be pregnant so i be   not really believe it jeff jill and then but the moment that i do the test i get so scared and i think oh my god like this be   not kid around like what if i be and t   be a distinct possibility and i get so scared like you jeff do you cry jill no i do   not cry but jill be here like she wa it be so scary and but you know we be watch it and it do   not turn blue or jeff aw jillyou know so it be you know it be jeff be you sure it would have be mine jill jeff jill jeff you know i would   have deny it f you if you say it be mine jill jilli be uh mess around with the repair man jeff honey jill aw jeffhoney i   be just kid my love jill jeff you   would sure learn a lot about me if that happen jillgosh jeff jill jeffaw honey that would just like ruin your whole idea of who i be hunh jill aw jeffit would just like i   would just blow up everything that we have if i if i be that cruel jill if you just refute it jeff if i say no way q jillt nunh unh i   be not take any responsibility q jeffif it   be mine then it   be your fault for get pregnant jill oh god jeffwould oh no jill jeff you think we   would be able to jill jeffto make it through that if i jill i do   not think s jeff would you would you be able to look above that jill would you forgive that jeff just let that one thing pass jill jeff no way jill jeff i would   not let you jill oh jeff well jill jeffi just want you to get pregnant so you could see how i   be gon na take it jill oh jeffi   will love you

idea about that as well seth now uh you be on propane out here larry no this be natural gas sethoh really larry yeah seth oh good larry kinda rare seth that   be good because uh the problem with propane be that they would   not be able to v the co the county would probably have a problem with it larry yeah seth cause they   be very concerned about propane but natural gas i can put a larry yeah we be real happy to get this place with natural gas seth do you want me to remove the old furnace larry we   will not have to seth no uh do you want me to remove it larryoh yes sethokay larry yeah seth larry no that   be that would be part of our deal yeah seth well y the new furnace w would be much small that much i can guarantee you larry alright seth do you larry seth how many square foot be the house larry uh well i guess it   be around twenty eight approximately seth okay larry i have a roof guy come about this time too so seth you   be do the roof larry doorbell rings we know who it be seth get a new roof put on too envradiobecomesaudible larrywell i get some problem with leakage in certain area and just get ta get it fix before we get the rain again alright well let   be start in the kitchen okay this be this be one right here see i do   not think you see this one but seth i   be wonder if you do   not have a floor plan of the house do you by any chance larry no we do   not seth larry we do   not get anything when we buy this baby seth i   be wonder if i should just sketch it out larry uh sethit   be two story though right larry two story seth th be there any register on the second floor larryunhunh seth okay larryso all those st all those stub that be behind us be the one that go up through the wall seth oh okay larry sethwell that   be no problem larry uh sethas long as i do   not have to do any ducte to the second floor larryyeah no they only the only thing that we want you to do be tie into the exist one seth okay larry which be on the ground level seth how about that one right there be that one larry uh yeah that   be one as well and then the return be back here seth okay good sized return larry yeah sethnow you   be not look at add air conditioning right larrywell we would like to have that as an option seth okay larry we could always add that later right seth yeah one of the thing you can do if if you do   not wan na do it now you can what they call prep for air conditioning you can put in the coil see you   have get the furnace and the coil larry yeah seth and then when you add air conditioning in the future all you got ta do be put the outdoor condense unit and refrigerant pipe to that coil so it save it save additional work in the future larry mhm sethotherwise you get ta come back and put the coil in which mean you get ta modify the duct work to get that coil in there so larry right seth if you   be think about do it in the future you might wan na at least put the coil in it only cost about three hundred fifty dollar for the coil larryoh alright seth it   be the it   be the outdoor air conditioning that larry well write that in there anyway in the in the quote seth and now that   be the the dining room you wan na add larryyeah if you if you go over and have a look at the dining room sethyou get a lotta glass in that room it look like larryyeah and we   be gon na be make change to the to the house too so we   be keep that in mind but if you notice there be no register in here so seth be this accessible larry oh yeah seth i wonder i wonder if be this add on you think larry seth maybe i   be just wonder if that foundation wall larry m it might   have be seth go to that i wonder if i can get into this larryoh you can get into it yeah seth okay larry oh yeah i   have be under here seth oh okay good larry so this be not a problem seth shoot i   would probably go with two register in this room larry alright sethi   would probably go like one here larry oh yeah sethand one one there larry you   would do one over there as well seth cause it   be a good sized room with a lot of glass larry okay seth or you could do it you know you could put like one on this wall and one on that wall larry okay on the two two outside seth and then i   would probably tie em both together larryyeah seth into one y branch you know like the room larry mhm seth the room be shape somewhat like this i could put like one there one there larrynow what we   would want you to do in this case be maybe seth tie those together like that larry see this this the end of this room might be modify so all we wan na know be be that we can eventually be able to do this alright to to get get this duct work do when we do when we do the modification to the seth oh so you may not do the duct work at this point larrynot not in this room seth do it in the future larrywe m yeah uh i i hate to see us do it seth where be gon na be your larry although if we do it in the sidewall sethwell what would the modification be larry oh we might take this out and we might push this out further and uh well here   be the drawing right here h let   be see that   be the guest house where be that sucker p seth dining room larry yeah yeah i it   be right i here it i here it i here it be right here seth be this the wall larryyou can see that this be the current wall seth oh okay so be you gon na go out like three foot or so larry so we might we might we might do a little modification seth a tape taper uh corner larry a tapered corner there so we might do a little of that seth okay larrybut if you   be gon na put it in h this end wall then maybe it would   not be affect that one might down there because we might uh seth yeah larry sethsee well larry see eventually we have s seth you know you   be right cause i cause we   be look at right there course now you gon na go out larry that   be right see we   be open this seththat   be gon na go that way larry that it   be that that that   be go out to this master which be gon na go up on the hill seth aw so you   will need what about heating for that larry well what we   be gon na do be put uh radiate heat seth okay larryin in there seth that   will be a slab floor then larry for sure yeah yeah uh seth so that one might change larry yeah seth uh larry i that   be a that   be a good point i   have i i   be not uh we be th seth the only thing be i do   not know how long be that gon na be like in the future like a year down the road larry yeah probably seth cause it would be nice to have heat in here in the meantime i mean say you do the furnace it would be nice to have it for this winter larrywell let me work that out with my wife put that as a seth but one thing you can do even if you do a modification you can move the register i mean say we put the register right here and that   be gon na b that would obviously have to be move you know it   be not a big deal to move it from here to here larry yeah sethyou might have to add a piece of duct work but it   be not gon na be a major change larryokay okay seth and this one you may not have to move at all that may be okay larry alright seth but then that   be probably how i   would do it some something like that or if i have the register go that way that might be the good way to do it it   would be like for fourteen by six larry seth i mean that would probably be an eight inch duct that   would be an eight inch that   would be a ten inch and then the furnace i do   not know it   be somewhere over there in that area larry furnace be sethi   be not sure how many foot larrywell the furnace sit down over in this this corner over here that   be where the furnace be seth one two larry probably right in here seth three larry and now that   be probably what that   be one of the seththat   be about thirty larry key my key concern seth about thirty six foot across larryis th be the how noisy the furnace be that   be a real concern to me and uh i do   not know what they   have get these day if they   be all i know there   be pulse type furnace which evidently be kinda loud or something sethoh yeah yeah lennox pulse larryoh really seth that   be a loud one larryis it seth yeah larry really sethi   have put a few of those in and they larry have you seth i   have have problem i would   not go with the lennox pulse larryokay seth if i go with a uh larry well sethi   would probably go with the carrier carrier furnace the return grill   be plenty big enough larry yeah it   be a big return seth i mean i ca   not you ca   not have any kind of problem there larryand a and and the pipe be big enough so and that   be normally when you get you get a lot of noise in the house be if your if your uh duct be too small right sethright yeah y the two main source of noise be either uh air noise which be due to undersized grill larryreally sethyou get air rush through there at high velocity the other source of noise be th be the fan motor itself larryin the in the actual seth in the unit itself larryunhunh sethand that   be usually solve by b just have flexible duct between the unit and the d and the register so that it dampen out the noise in other word if we have the furnace like right behind that wall it would be noisy larry yeah sethbut we   be go d i   be not sure how it connect do we see that down there i   will have to go down and take a look at that again but larry okay seth i imagine it go down and then we can run some kind of a flexible duct to the unit as long as i can get say ten foot or so between that and the unit then i larry you can seth then i can uh eliminate th the noise problem larry alright seth so it   be basically thirty by thirty return air thirty by thirty return air larry and this be a uh this be the only return and i   would i would say not seth oh this be return also larry not place not place very well in the room seth this be larry so seththis be supply though right larry this be the supply right sethokay yeah larry see and i   would where would you suggest they would go if uh if we put uh seth boy i would say g i   would probably go with two i   would put one on each side i   would probably put one like right underneath that window there and maybe underneath that window be nice to put it behind the couch but then you   have it would be block off too much larry and you thi you so you you p you try and put em under window where that   be where your seth yeah i try to put em on the cold larry sethbasically the cold part of the room larryokay seth because uh it just help y because otherwise you know with a grill right here you end up have cold spot on the side larrymhm sethcause what happen be the air go back to the return grill so it never really larry it would   not get out circulate through sethit never really blow out to the corner larryright sethso that   be why i try to put it as far away on the perimeter and have it pull across the room larry okay well this be the only seth so i do   not know if you   would wan na larry the only the only other addition room where we think maybe register would be important and i   would i do   not know if uh floor register be there be th i i i be d do it that   be not a good idea these day seth no i would go with floor register in this house cause you get high ceiling larry seth well in fact you would   not be able to put any kind of ceiling register in cause you get the second floor larryright seth so no floor register be fine for heat larry but th you   be talk about wall regis put em in the wall here seth no i be i be think about put em in the floor larryoh in the floor seth yeah to to go in the wall would be pretty tough larryokay alright sethi do   not know if you wan na cut the floor though larry yeah well i hate to do it right there may maybe we   would do it right in here seth yeah but to get in the wall would be almost larry seth i mean you can do that during new construction but it   be tough when you   be come back after the fact cause you just get larrysure sethyour your two by four framing and it   be just too tough to get in there larry okay alright so we   would put a couple in this room somewhere and then uh seth so this be like a family room be that what this be larry uh it   be kinda like a lo kinda a little parlor library something resemble seth alright larry this be a register so that   be okay cause it   be under there seth okay larry the bathroom have a register now that be it seth how about the uh thermostat larry this guy seth okay i would definitely go with a new thermostat larry yeah kind of a antique seth but that   be probably a good that   be probably a good spot larryis   not it sethyeah that should be in a museum larry uh i do   not know i i be we do the right if i   be suppose to kinda walk you around the house here be that what uh seth yeah do you think envradiobecomesinaudible seth well i guess you have   not really larryi do   not know if there   be anything you need to do up here other than the fact just kinda know that we   have get em seth yeah you have   not r really live in the house during the winter have you larryno and that   be what we th sethso you do   not really know if there   be a larrysee and that   be what we think we would do uh sethso you   be not really sure if there   be any problem with heat certain area larry that   be right so i sa seth so we do   not know if there   be any particular area like that b i bet you that parlor room have have a hard time in the past larry do you think it   be pretty cool in there seth just that one grill larry and then this guy have a register so sethoh they get ac up here too larry yeah i n i think that   be gon na go seth well uh especially if you get the force air heating and cool larry well yes sethyou wo   not need that larry one little guy there seth yeah see these be   not strategically place either but you   have pretty much get no choice on most of these these it   be almost impossible to to change these now but really on the second floor larry this one   be not too bad seth the heat the heat   be gon na rise from the first floor anyway larryyeah up to you know seth so i larryand it   will hold it in here real well seth yeah typically and if anything you have verheating problem larry mm yeah sethon the second floor larry well see that   be what we want to do be have some kind of a system that we know we can shut off certain certain area like if w seth one of the thing we could do i do   not think they have any damper here do they oh they do larry yeah seth so you can close off larry oh okay so that   be how it   be seth yeah you can close off individual d larry close these off seth larry and then the then it   will force the air what down into seth downstairs now larry seththe one thing you do   not wan na do though be close off too many of em larry cause then you put a strain on the seth cause cause then you   be uh yeah you   have get ta have a certain amount of air for the furnace to work properly and if you reduce the airflow too much then it wo   not have enough air go across the heat exchanger and it   will it   will overheat the heat exchanger larryoh really okay seth so i would say envradiobecomesaudible sethyou do   not want to close more than uh more than about twenty five percent of em or you can close em y you know if you close em uh a a hundred percent if you close em all the way you probably do   not want to shut more than hx twenty five percent of em all the way larry seth which would b i   be not sure maybe all upstairs you might wan na leave em crack open just a little bit though larryunhunh sethjust to make sure you get enough air larryyeah seth but okay so we   would be look at add two two register for that parlor room larry add two to that parlor room seth and then what about that one do you wan na hold off on that larrywell maybe we should just seth or would you wan na do at least one of em larry i think we should do something yeah only because seth because if that remodel   be a year away then larry i i th i guess i th i think this thing be gon na be a cold little seth oh i can definitely see that larry i i i can tell you that because the window seth see you only like the only heat you have in this room be that one register over there larry the window in this thing be thum just about ready to fall out i mean they   be thump they   be not look at this so i know there   be gon na be a lot of uh seth a lotta infiltration larryyeah until we get this correct seth see hopefully you   will go with double pane glass on your remodel larry seth that   will help cut down a lot larryyeah sethon your larry yeah seth heat loss larry so i mean in some way have window be it a bad idea because you get a lot of natural heat from the the s from sun seth that   be right larry you know seth okay this be like it would get larry so seththis be like east face right larryyeah the s in in seth so you get some morning sun larryyou get the morning in the winter it   be gon na come right across like this seth yeah larryso sethso that   be gon na be good larryso that   will be good so maybe one register in here for the moment until we kinda feel it out would be uh seth sure i mean this one it look like if we put a register over here you would   not have to change it anyway larry yeah no that that seth with your remodel that might work into it larry yeah seth and like i say even i even if you do have to move it it   be not a big deal i mean somebody just move it larry okay seth you know a carpenter can do it even you do   not even need to have us come out and do it really you might have to add a buy a piece of flexible duct and stick it on there but it   be not a larry yeah seth not a big deal larry okay alright seth okay larrywell that sound good sethwell let me check downstairs again i get ta take some measurement on that room larry okay well now you get you   have get the logistic of every oh wait and then i think my wife seth now you now you say about larry my wife say she would like to have a register put in this room and i think it   be kinda weird but what do you think why would she seth what be this what be this room use for larry well eventually this be gon na be uh and we   be gon na open this up we   be gon na take out some of these shelf and get some light to come through here seth this be sort of like a pantry larry but kinda pantry area but it   be gon na be an extension of the kitchen kind of so i do   not know if sethi   would yeah i   would put i   would probably put one like right there about right there larry sethyou gon na be put anything there larry wh i think wh seth probably something   be gon na go there right a table or something larry i do   not know i yeah sethcause that   be about the only spot you can put it well i mean y we could put a we could put a floor r floor register right along here i do   not know if you   would want that but that   be probably where i   would put it in fact the one that i be gon na put in there i   would probably larrywe might have trouble get to this spot though i think sethyou think so larry yeah cause it start get real tight up there on this end yeah well let   be uh seth maybe on this end larry yeah it would have to be if anywhere it   would have to be down seth that   be not a bad spot larry okay seth it   be gon na help out cause i see this whole area you   have just get that one grill it   be a pretty good sized area right here larry okay sethwhat about the kitchen larry well let   be let   be consider that seth kitchen   be get one larry kitchen   be get one right here seth yeah okay larry and uh i   be not too worried about the kitchen i do   not like hot kitchen anyway cause i mean y you get a stove go and ah we   be in good shape that way ah wait a minute do i forget something else too ah yeah we   be gon na have to put a register out here because y this this wall be eventually gon na come out and so uh seth utility room larry utility room but it   be gon na eventually be part of the kitchen and we   be move the utility room so and this t this be a joke nlook at this seth larry seth well some of these larry maybe maybe this do   not make any sense to sethwell some of these thing you may wan na wait until you do the remodel like larry i   be th i   be i   am wa i   be begin to wonder if sethbecause what i would prob what you can do uh larry hiccup sethis tap right off the plenum cause the furnace be somewhere in that general area larry it   be right there yeah seth and you can just tap right off the plenum with a duct and bring it to this room larryokay well that   be what we want to seth so that can be do larrythat   be what we wan na kn wan na know seththat can be do at a later time larry alright but maybe t seth that can be do at at any time larrymaybe for the sake of your quotation sethreally larryyou should say this be what it   be gon na cost you to put in a duct here all these duct at this time seth yeah okay larrynow i do   not know if if we can price em out individually or not seth sure i call this what utility r utility room larryyeah just pu uh call it a sethfigure a duct somewhere on this wall you think larry yeah let   be just assume it   would be on this wall seth okay utility room kitchen that back one we   will call that pantry larry yeah pantry and then you get the dining room glass seth dining room larryglass dining room seth and then the parlor larry and then the parlor one on each end there seth yeah cause we can do em now or we can do em later but it   be not any more difficult to do em at a later time so it   be not like you have to do it now larryokay seth so the register that we   be connect to that be exist how many of those we have get we   have get the one in the kitchen and then we   have get uh one in the d living room here larry that guy then there   be one in the bathroom there   be one in the s study and there be one in the library or in the parlor i do   not know what we   would do with that do we disconnect that if we put two or do you leave it seth uh yeah i might disconnect that well it   be not it   be not connect up right now so larry oh that   be right seth so it   would just be a matter w actually it sh it should be cap off probably though and this be the study one right there and the bathroom   be get one larry bathroom   be get one over by the shower there on the floor seth okay okay let me take a look downstairs again larry okay seth at that furnace danny this morning we   be gon na be look in the book of exodus and we   have be talk about uh vision and hear from god i be try to come up with a definition in fact i i look it up in the encyclopedia for vision and there be definitely a definition several uh and i do   not really like any of them uh so i think i   would try to come up with one of my own jim larson be uh share a quote from yogi bara last night and i want to share that this morning he say you get ta be careful when you do   not know where you   be go because you might not get there which say so much that we need to know where we   be go and vision really have to do with have an idea of where you   be go our mission be a goal or task which one be destine to accomplish our vision and here   be the here   be the definition i come up with you can write this down but uh uh do   not use it unless you uh agree with it aud danny it   be mentally see aud dannywhere one hope to be in a specific period of time it   be in your imagination in your hope that you   be look ahead and h try to see where you will be in a specific period period of time so our vision for the next few year our vision for uh the next ten year whatever uh what be our vision as a church planter pastor queen come have grow up here and have go off to to school to seminary god bring him back to start a church and he begin to seek god   be uh vision for the church and through his own personal experience and through the scripture and god give him a vision for a church that be commit to be a part of what god be do a church that be invest in build the kingdom of god by care for people where their need be and by share the truth of the gospel of jesus christ our vision be be a direction of involvement toward a final destination when i start think about mission i think immediately of the blue brother you know and dan ackroyd come out i forget what his character be but he say we   be on a mission from god q and that   be what the church be about we   be on a mission from god in fact let me clarify it a little more the church have be give a mission but our mission be not for us to go and decide what we   be gon na do our mission be to participate in an to carry out god   be mission because you see god be on a mission god   be mission be to build his kingdom to build the kingdom of god to bring the world of lose people into a real and personal love relationship with him through faith in his son jesus christ you know what if our vision do not include reach lose people and care for lost people then it   be not god   be vision because the bible be very clear that god care about lose people audyes danny god love people who do   not have it all together audyes danny god love people who be hurt audyes danny god love people who be suffer who be seek and if our vision as uptown baptist church do   not include in fact if our vision as individual christian with a relationship with christ do not include reach out and touch the life of lose hurt die people it   be not a vision from god because god   be plan be and have always be to use his people to carry out his mission and we   be gon na see that as we look at moses begin in the first chapter of moses i   be not gon na read i be gon na read some of it but i   be not gon na read all the way through because we   be gon na try to breeze through the first four chapter let   be look how god be involve in moses or how god involve moses in his mission gary one of the thing i want us to do uh on build beautiful day be build a tall podium many laughter dannywrite that on one of those sheet of paper back there we we need it about right here many laughter danny oop okay first thing we   be gon na see be that god prepare his servant for mission god prepare his servant for mission as we read in actually as we get to the second chapter we   will see that uh moses be not only preserve but he be prepare uh for his part in god   be mission we have to go to chapter one to get a little background read with me in verse six of chapter one read now joseph and all his brother and all that generation die but the israelites be fruitful and multiply greatly and become exceedingly numerous so that the land be fill with them then a new king who do not know about joseph come to power in egypt look he say to his people the israelites have become much too numerous for us come we must deal shrewdly with them for or they will become even more numerous and if war break out will join our enemy fight against us and leave the country so they put the slave master over them to oppress them and f with force labor and they build python and ramse as store city for pharaoh but the more they be oppress the more they multiply and spread so the egyptians come to dread the israelites and work them ruthlessly they make their life bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kind of work in the field in all their hard labor the egyptians use them ruthlessly read the king or the pharaoh be a little upset because the israelites who be their slave who be their servant as they take a census they realize that the israelites ' number be catch up with their own of the egyptians and this be upset because he see this as a national threat from his perspective they w they r you know he just know that they be gon na grow to a number and they be gon na outnumber the egyptians and then they be just gon na take over you know if any other country decide to attack uh and to to battle uh the egyptians that he just know that the israelites be gon na join them and be gon na overthrow from the inside so the next part of the chapter he begin to you know first of all he b he work the man very hard he say man if i work these guy hard there not gon na be go home to their wife and there not gon na be uh have baby aud danny you know i guess that be part of his plan that   be his first strategy aud dannyso let   be make it hard for them let   be really work work em aud danny so that they   be too tired to go home and and uh aud dannyprocreate manylaughter danny we   will use that word but that do   not work cause they st they continue to many laughter danny they continue they continue to d to uh have baby and they continue to multiply aud danny so he g devise another plan he go to the midwife you know the israelites have midwife they do   not have doctor but they have uh woman who when a when one of the israelite woman be gon na have a baby then these midwife just come in and help in the labor process or in the birthing process and so he go to the midwife and say listen here   be what i want you to do you go and you go ahead and you do your part and you help these these mother but if they have a boy i want you to make sure that that boy die if it   be a girl you go ahead and let it live and that be his plan well the midwife you know what could they say this be the the pharaoh so they agree to it but then they do   not do it because they fear god more than they do pharaoh and when uh he call em he say what   be go on they   be still multiply there   be still boy be bear here aud danny what be go on the midwife say well these these mother they   be have the baby without us you know they   be not tell us and they   be just go ahead and have em they   be s sturdy woman many laughter danny it say they do   not need us and so pharaoh come up with another plan it end up in the final verse of this chapter verse twenty two read then pharaoh give this order to all his people every boy that be bear must be you must throw into the nile but let every girl live read so he   be order his people to go and every boy that be bear to the israelites to to kill em throw em in the river well moses be bear about this time and this be how god preserve moses now moses   be mother love her child and she do   not want to throw him in i do   not think any of the mother do and she be   not gon na do it herself and she be one of these that have the baby without tell anybody except her immediate family and moses already when he be bear have an old sister and an old brother and the mother now when i be grow up and i hear this story i just assume that the mother be hide the baby in the reed and that   be where she be hide him but it say for three month she hide the baby do   not say anything about the the in the river or in the in the uh basket uh but then when he be three month old she j she be assume that she be gon na get catch pretty soon and so she devise a plan and it do   not say here that she devise a plan but believe me this mother know what she be do she b she m get a basket she perhaps make the basket probably do and then she put what they call pitch or tar uh on it so that it would float so that water would   not come up through it and she put a blanket put the baby in it wrap the baby in it and she tell she bring it down to the river now she do   not just go anywhere in the river she bring it to a specific place not just because there be reed there but because the pharaoh   be daughter bathe there and this be a select place the mother take the baby put the baby put moses in the water and tell her sister to keep an eye on it to keep an eye on him so that nothing bad happen but also there be an another motive that we   will get to in just a second so the w so moses be float along in the water the pharaoh   be daughter come down to to take her bath and she see the basket and she send her servant out to get the basket and bring it to her and she open it up there   be moses and he begin to cry and pharaoh   be daughter feel sorry for moses and she just decide to keep him it say she realize say this be an israelite baby aw aw poor thing aud danny and so she she decide to keep him well here   be what pha uh moses   be sister do that be her cue she come out from hide and say oh whatever your name be many laughter dannysay oh mighty princess allow me to get a nurse for the baby i know of an israelite nurse that can take care of this baby guess who her mother so she go and get the mother now why do i think this be something that the mother know about cause it end up that the mother not only have her child to stay alive but she also get to take care of him and get pay for it many laughter danny so god not only spare his life but he provide uh for for that whole family but especially for moses so we see how god preserve moses we also see how god prepare moses because in the moses   be life be kinda divide into three stage each be forty year the first forty year he be in egypt the second forty year he be a shepherd and the third forty year he be lead the people out of israel and in this first forty year moses get the good training in the world at that time his foundational training come from his mother cause as the nanny and that   be what she be at that point even though she be his mother she be his nanny she train him in the foundation uh train him teach him who he be teach him about his hebrew origin and the custom of the israel israelites teach him the foundational belief in the true god teach him of god   be promise to abraham to multiply his descendant and make a mighty nation of them probably the first four or five year the bulk of his time be spend with his mother and he i   be sure she tell him that that uh she be his mother his real mother and and about what have happen cause we would   not know about it uh if she do   not but not only do he get this religious training and this foundational belief in a r in a real god but he also be expose to the good education that egypt have to offer expose to the wise teacher and the good culture offer in the world at that time he learn about the politic and custom of the court of course this would help him later on when he have to come back and and uh and deal with the court from a different perspective but that first forty year be spend in be train and he be train well and he have great knowledge a lot of knowledge that he be uh that god provide for him through these mean and then for the next forty year he be exile from egypt because in order to think that because he be an israelite by birth uh and see an israeli be abuse uh he step in and he kill the egyptian that be abuse him think that no one else know except this person that he have save he bury him and then a few day later you know think well it   be it   be all cool nobody know i   will just go on he try to help or try to intervene between two other uh hebrew that be argue amongst themself and and he try to be a peacemaker and they say you know who make you judge w what about this you just kill the guy the other day uh and he realize that people know and he realize if these if these man know then probably pharaoh be gon na hear pretty soon and so he leave he flee he run he go out into the wilderness after a few day of uh walk he come upon a a scene where these two young lady be herd their father   be sheep and uh some uh mean guy who know i do   not remember who it be but anyway they come up and try to to uh take advantage of the two lady try to take care of the sheep and uh and i i assume they be try to steal the sheep or try to steal the woman either way uh but moses intervene and he run them off and save their life and save their livestock and so they invite him to come with them to to their home and they tell their father what have happen and he invite moses to stay with them moses end up marry uh one of the young lady as ken share with us the other day it be a a mixed marriage because these uh this family be black so for the next forty year he become a sheep herder for his father in law who be a a midian priest and during that forty year he he g gain some other training first of all he become an outdoorsman he become used to be out in the wilderness and that   be gon na be important for him for his final forty year another thing he   be be the area where he herd the sheep be a a huge area and uh he get to know the terrain he get to know his way around and that be important because he be gon na spend his final forty year in that same area and it be important that he know where there the w waterhole be and and where the dangerous area be uh and so god prepare him god also have prepare us and be prepare us for h for our part in god   be mission god be continually build character and i think this middle forty year for moses be a be a time where god really build character cause he no longer have everything he want uh at his fingertip uh he have to learn some thing he have to learn he have to learn how to depend on god on this god that he have learn about from his mother and god be interested in build character in us as individual in fact god be more concerned about our character than what we do and how we do it and so a lot of what we experience we get frustrated with but god   be purpose be to build character within us and so when we   be try to decide w which we should do or not do something that we   be tempt to do we need to remember that god   be more concerned about our character and we should be obedient to him because that   be how he build our character i believe that god have create and preserve and prepared uptown baptist church to be involve in his mission to be involve in reach out to the unloved and the hurting to be an influence to the community of uptown for the kingdom of god to be a beacon of light for those who be lose and as our sign say on top to proclaim that christ die for our sin god have also create and prepared uptown baptist church to be a model for urban church mission to the world and that be   not our reasoning we do   not set out to do the thing we do so that we could be a model or so that we could get publicity but god have see see fit to use us in that way and this be not for our pride this be just a reality i   be amazed at how people from all over the world have have come to the city and they   have come to uptown baptist church because they hear about us somewhere else in another country or they read a book uh that talk about uptown baptist church god have crea also create an prepared you and me to be involve in his plan first of all he   be call us each to a love relationship with him some of us have accept that call and some be still struggle with it but still he want to have a love relationship with each person that be in this room he   be bring us together from many background many very different background to be a family a family of follower of christ a family to be involve in god   be mission build the kingdom of god i be talk to greg on friday greg gey and he be share wi somehow we get in a conversation and he be say something about he he really need intellectual stimulation because he tend to be more intellectual and we be talk about why some people be intellectual and some be   not and god just flash in my mind and i say greg you know god create you to be intellectual so that you could relate to other who be intellectual so that you could share with them on their level because god do   not create us for our purpose god create us for his purpose and that   be something we have to keep in before us god have create us make us like we be allow us to experience the thing that we have experience for his purpose and it   be for us to seek him and to know what his purpose be papa joe have be a a very strong influence in this community not because of his education his education come from the street and as he come to a relationship with jesus christ he come from a background that w have survive from the street he be an alcoholic now w how why have god use him he be   not educate he do   not go through special training it   be because god prepare him with the experience of his life so that he could reach out to other people who be go through the same experience so you ca   not say well i do   not have an education or i do   not i ca   not speak or i ca   not do this you have to know that whatever god have give you whatever experience that god have bring you through that he want to use it to reach people for his kingdom the second thing i want us to know from this st story of moses be that god reveal his mission to his servant envsirenbegin danny the first that god prepare his servant for his mission the second be that god reveal his mission to his servant we have to go to exodus three and see how god get moses   be attention sherry apricot mustard sauce beth liver and onion mm sherry you should get a philadelphia cheese steak beth how about if i pick for you and you pick for

do   not get to see her mother ben okay folk we   be come to a short stairway use the handrail and be careful please envfootstepsandambientcrowdnoise benokay folk let   be find out where we be we get on the elevator right here come down and stand on the balcony overlook the power plant down that stairway out on the power plant ramp about that far then right at that yellow line and you   be now stand over the second large water pipe in the world and it   be call a penstock more about that a little bit later the colorado river flow in this direction in order to build a dam here the very first thing they have to do be to get rid of that river so they come up here above where the dam be to be build and drill and blast out four diversion tunnel two on either side into the canyon wall around where the dam be to be build out in the river down below each one of these tunnel be drill and blast out at fifty six foot in diameter and then line with three foot of concrete you   be now stand in one of those old diversion tunnel they then come up here and they build a cofferdam about a hundred foot high to force this river into these diversion tunnel come back down here build the other part of that cofferdam about sixty five foot high to keep this water from back into the work area they now have from here to here where they could build a dam they pump the water out of this area and excavate down another hundred and thirty five foot to bedrock okay folk if you will please take a look at this picture take during construction look like a series of box or block stack one on top of the other and those be wooden concrete form each one of those form be exactly five foot high but they do vary in area somewhat because they do not build the dam right straight across the river from canyon wall to canyon wall they build it in the form of an arc and it   be call an arch gravity design dam where the force of the water come down the colorado river hit the face of the dam and tend to try to drive these wingtip further into the canyon wall it   be a very strong design they do build two concrete mix plant here they do pour concrete for twenty four hour a day seven day a week three hundred and sixty five day a year for two year less six day now every bit of that concrete come down in individual eight cubic yard bucketload eight cubic yard of concrete into one of these form the small of which be twenty two by twenty five foot only fill that form up about three or four inch deep so there go that story you may have hear that there be worker bury in the concrete here could   not possibly happen but what they do bury in that freshly pour concrete be one inch steel water pipe they come down here in this low cofferdam and they build an ice plant capable of make a thousand ton of ice a day they use that ice to chill the water that they force through that pipe in this newly place concrete as concrete harden or cure as we call it it produce heat the more you can control that heat the well job of cure you   be go to get so they use the chill water method of take that cold water force it through that pipe in that newly place concrete pick up some of that heat then carry that heat out and away they feel if they do not use a method such as this that it would   have take approximately one hundred and fifty year for the concrete in the interior part of the dam to cool down so the system do work and then it harden and they remove these wooden form they leave void vertically and horizontally these form come together those void be fill with grout under high pressure grout be a mixture of concrete and water when this be do you have what we call a modify monolithic pour or basically a solid block of concrete which when complete would be six hundred and sixty foot across the base fourty five foot across the top twelve hundred and fourty four foot from wingtip to wingtip seven hundred and twenty six point four foot high six point six million ton of concrete that   be enough concrete to build a two lane highway from new york city to san francisco or put another way a four foot wide sidewalk from the north pole to the south pole then they have to protect that concrete a little bit the next thing they have to do then be build a couple of spillway as you get out of your car or your bus this afternoon you may have notice those spillway here they be one on either side what they do be they come in here and they block these diversion tunnel off in this area through here close these gate up here now this yellow part be forever under water underneath that lake out there and completely useless but they do incorporate into the design of the dam the balance of those diversion tunnel use these outer two as spillway tunnel now these spillway be build so that the top of the spillway be twenty seven foot low than the top of the dam this assure us that n any excess water come down the colorado river rather than overtop the dam overtop these spillway on either side go into the canyon wall around the dam out in the river down below each one of these spillway be capable of handle two hundred thousand cubic foot per second of water that   be the same amount of water that go over niagara falls fall three time high than niagara falls do time that water reach this area down in here it be flow at between one hundred and one hundred and twenty mile an hour okay we have protect the spillway now they have to get some water into the power plant what they do be they build four intake tower two on either side of the river on ledge above the river each of those tower that you see out there in that lake be three hundred and ninety five foot high each with two eleven by thirty two foot gate in them one gate near the bottom one about half way up to let the water in the water then come into the penstock like the one we   be stand over right now this penstock you can see on either side of us out here be three story high or thirty foot in diameter make of two and three quarter inch steel boilerplate make in section twenty two foot long each section weigh approximately a hundred and fifty ton each of these twenty two foot section be join to the next section use pressure pin like this the water pressure in that penstock out there this afternoon approximately two hundred and thirty four pound per square inch okay we have the water this far now we divert that into thirteen foot penstock or water pipe each one of em go to a turbine the force of the water turn the turbine which turn the rotor in the generator and generate power the water then come on the tailrace we see it up there and go on downstream to be use at least six more time before it reach the mexican border to generate more power good clean reusable non pollute source of energy the cost of the project a hundred and seventy five million dollar i say project because that include the building of the dam the building of boulder city about seven mile up the road the highway and the railway from las vegas out here to the dam site and in southern california they build the all american canal which take water to the people and the crop of the imperial and coachella valley this money be borrow on a fifty year term at three percent interest and be pay off in full in nineteen eighty seven the people who work here and they do work twenty four hour a day average twenty four hour work force be about thirty five hundred man the most they have at any one time be when they be pour concrete fourty three hundred man the laborer on the job make fifty cent an hour highest pay man on the project be a power shovel operator at a dollar and a quarter an hour out of each man   be paycheck the contractor do deduct each day a dollar and sixty cent because the contractor be feed and house the man in boulder city and take them back and forth out here to the job site they do have ninety six industrial death the big single category of death be classify as fall material basically fall rock but they do have some kill by explosion some by drown some by electrocution and other type of accident you might expect to have on a job of this magnitude they do complete the project two year ahead of schedule and under budget start in early nineteen thirty one complete in late nineteen thirty five just twelve day short of five year do i have any question aud what   be this overhead pipe here ben the overhead pipe that   be the fresh air pipe in the summertime the temperature of the air outside get to be as high as a hundred and twenty degree so they bring that fresh air in and they pass that fresh air over a sump at the base of the dam the water in that sump be a constant fifty three degree it cool that air down to between sixty eight and seventy two degree then they force it back throughout the dam so it   be air conditioning without refrigeration like a big evaporative cooler or swamp cooler any other question yes aud uh during the uh earthquake this morning do you have any sensor down here that measure any kind of movement of structure ben right yes w v we have several thing first place we have three seismograph throughout the dam we record those but nobody down here feel em but we do have sensor build right into the concrete any movement that concrete make be measure and record and they have very little of it this morning very little any other question aud how far be you send electricity california ben okay fifty six percent of our power go to southern california twenty five percent of it stay in nevada nineteen percent of it go to arizona what the government do be they get together the delegate from those three state in nineteen thirty to allocate the power that would be generate here when this dam be complete california be grow very fast at that time so they ask for and get most of the power but by the same token las vegas about thirty five mile up the road here at that time be nothing but a watering stop on the railroad no hotel no casino we ask las vegas to take five percent of the power we could produce here and they agree to do that but that   be all they get today because that contract be good through the year two thousand and seventeen so all those light you see burn up there in las vegas come from power from steam plant own and operate by nevada power company use fossil fuel they get very little of our hydroelectric power okay folk you can follow me now i   be gon na lead us out of here okay here we go folk envfootstepsandambientcrowdnoise aud quite amazing ben y yes it   be a fantastic job they do down here audyeah envfootstepsandambientcrowdnoise audabout how many people be employ here now ben right now there   be about two hundred that include the security people the guide force the nursing staff the people that run the computer room the office force as well as the people that work on the dam and that   be a twenty four hour figure but that figure be become small every year because every year we be become more highly computerized f okay folk there   be a tour group come in stay to your right please stay to your right f envambientcrowdnoise benf stay to your right folk tour group come out f envcrowdandmachinenoise ben okay if you would right up this stairway when you get on the balcony wait for me on the blue couch on the balcony please anybody need the elevator it   be available envcrowdandmachinenoise benanybody that need the elevator it   be be available envcrowdandmachinenoise ben come on envcrowdandmachinenoise ben come on then up the stairway if you can p up the stairway that   be up the stair p okay here we go hi aud that be the turbine over here off to the side benyeah that   be the turbine runner you bet that   be a computer design make of stainless steel it   be design in such a way there   be one of em run at a hundred and eighty rpm it actually lift that eight hundred ton up a quarter of an inch for your main thrust bearing be the very top of this uh structure right down here this be the rotor the rotor and the runner have come out of our a seven generator what happen we lose a water seal down there so we have to pull those out to fix that water seal they   will be replace within a couple of week now aud oh i see ben that rotor in that part of the shaft weigh five hundred and eighty ton aud envambientnoise benff okay folk if you will please follow me now ff envcrowdnoiseandfootstep hey benhow you do good envcrowdnoise benokay folk while we   be wait for the elevator do anybody have any question aud how long have you be do these tour benabout five year about five year i   have retire twice ca   not stand retirement so come back to work at a fun job aud oh ben anybody have any question aud yeah ben water come down the center of the where your shaft be go out the turbine ben no go around the dam water come into those tower go around the dam come in from the side audeach individual turbine ben yeah audthe water drop in the center where the shaft go in then go down benno no no it come into what they c it come in that thirteen foot pipe go into what they call the area of the wicket gate and there and there   be a pipe around that wicket gate and that pipe go from a thirteen foot diameter down to a three foot diameter go around that wicket gate okay audright ben it pick up speed by the time it enter that ap go out that aperture that three foot aperture it   be travel at fifty seven mile an hour but that   be what drive that big turbine it go around the shaft it do   not go into the shaft area at all the wicket gate all the water go in through the wicket gate aud it   be come in underneath benyeah the wick audperpendicular ben th well audperpendicular to the shaft ben and yeah audthe generator   be sit on top bena i okay the shaft be like this and water   be come in like this audright that   be what i think ben and then it go around like this audoh yeah ben and then out audnow that thing we see down lay that uh alongside benokay audwith the uh look like a benthat   be a that   be a r turbine runner we call turbine runner audthat and that   be be that be that kick up on the side like that the water ben no it just lay it audspinne it around ben oh you mean the one d on the floor down there audyeah yeah benno that   be lay flat like this aud benand the water drive that around this way like this aud oh you   be right benand drive the turbine up there yeah audand that   be down inside the uh in the turbine benthat   be way down yeah way down in the turbine audso it   be in the turbine and that   be the benunhunh yeah audthat   be what   be generate benyeah audthat   be what   be turn the wheel benright right audwe be right on that benright okay folk step right in the elevator please right on in step right in the elevator three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen nineteen twenty p alright be you with them okay p okay i save room for you aud all right thank a lot man benyou bet folk this do conclude your tour of the dam hope you enjoy it as much as i enjoy have you come back and see us again have any question on the way up ask norm bye bye folk okay any more question folk aud what   be the story with this tile be   not this create by somebody benyeah folk the dam be build as a tourist attraction as well as be very functional this terrazzo flooring you see terrazzo be marble chip put down in concrete ground down and polish this terrazzo flooring be put in here by one italian family by the name of martina okay there   be two and three quarter acre of this uh t uh terrazzo flooring in the floor but the design you see be what that italian family see and interpretate from southwest indian blanket and pottery that   be where the design come from any other question aud be there just two elevator down from these two shaft that   will take you to benthat   be right two elevator down mhm audthe rest of it   be just solid benright well there be there be two mile of tunnel go this way across the dam they have a pipe gallery they have a drainage gallery they have a a uh cable gallery and they have an instrumentation gallery and all those thing be they measure constantly the condition of the dam with that instrumentation gallery aud y' all open seven day a week ben yeah mhm aud be it unusual to to do the generator uh room floor in something like this there   be just benyeah it it   be in fact it be build during the depression and they want to make it a tourist attra aud make it make it worth talk benit be at that time the large dam in the world they want to make it very nice yeah it   be unusual usually you just have concrete deck audyeah i would yeah benyeah yeah any other question folk yes aud what be the chance of a leak ben hm aud audwhat be the chance of a leak ben well it leak all the time you see concrete   be porous and because concrete   be porous there   be water come through at all time but that   be good because if there   be no moisture in concrete it dry out and spall and chip and turn to powder would   not make a very good dam so as long as that lake be back there force that water through the concrete at all time it keep that concrete in a stage of what we call be green green concrete   be very strong so we have a good strong dam aud say ben ben yes audwhat   be go on up on the hill up here do   not think it   be uh benokay that   be a five story parking garage and the new building be a new visitor center the five story parking garage will hold four hundred and fifty car okay the new f visitor center will have three revolving theater in it it   will have a seating area for people go on tour it   will have a museum the top deck of that building will be an observation platform we can look back at the dam in one direction downstream in the other now when that   be all do they hope to be able to figure to handle between one point two and one point three million people a year last year we have seven hundred and twenty nine thousand eight hundred and eighty nine people go through the dam but we have to turn people away almost every night just not enough time in the day to get everybody through the dam that would like to see it aud hmm will it have any slot machine in it ben no but it   would be a good idea aud benwould   not it aud ben pay for this place aud audwhen   be completion on that parking garage ben they figure between fifteen and seventeen month yeah okay folk step right in the elevator please right on in envcrowdnoise everyone please face the front of the car audit   be gon na be seventeen more month seventeen more month everyone face the front of the car please ben right to there front of the car please aud have they ever have to use the spillway benjust a minute okay folk this do conclude your tour of the dam i hope you enjoy it as much as i enjoy have you come back and see us again have any question on the way up ask norm bye bye folk audthanks ben aud have they ever have to use the spillway benokay folk the question be do they ever have to use the spillway yes just once in the history of the dam and that be nineteen eighty three what happen that year be they have a very heavy snowpack in the rocky mountain and that be follow by rain and hot weather which create a flooding condition we have more water come down the colorado river system than they could put through the power plant every reservoir in the colorado river system be full to overflow that year on july second water overtop our spillway out here six day later it be go over four and a half foot high and that go on for sixty six day at the end of that time there be no damage to the dam or to the power plant but further on downstream where people have build in the floodplain they do have thirty million dollar worth of damage but no loss of life but that flood   be what leave that white line around the lake out there that white line indicate it be go over the spillway four and a half foot above floodstage it give a false impression and make it look like the lake of the level be low or level the lake of the low actually we   be eight foot above normal for this time of year aud wow ben yeah we have a very good snowpack last year kirsten um first of all maybe you guy can tell me we talk a little bit about it last time you be here or do we not talk about the history of the penguin amy thank doni be   not here that weekend lori no no kirstenokay loriwe talk about the endanger species kirstenokay we have lori kirsten on exhibit now about l twenty five of the thirty penguin chicks l amy wow kirstenthat you have envmicnoise kirsten um lorioop kirsten last year i s want to say around christmas time we go down the shed aquarium as well as other researcher and scientist go down to antarctica to collect lori mm kirstengentu penguin egg okay so i want to go into a little bit about the history of the gentus here um for you for don and lori where where do our original gentu penguin come from don uh faulkland be   not it kirsten where do the but specifically donoh specifically in the island kirstenwhere do we get them for display here at the shed aquarium donoh from the um be it edinburgh uh zoo kirstenyeah great don yeah kirstenin scotland donyeah right kirsten okay amyare those the one that do   not like people the hand off one kirsten hand off one p amythat come from where   be ten from kirsten there amyor be that oh okay kirstenyeah amy well be what   be the other specie kirsten rockhopper amy the no kirsten magellanics donmagellanic lori amyyeah okay kirstenra magellanics come from the john ball zoo in grand rapids michigan donmhm kirsten so the gentus which i take it you work mammal as well amy yeah kirstenokay so feel free to add in amyi work with the baby penguin when cause i   have only work like a weekend but both day be spend with the penguin feed the baby penguin and then ten and all of them kirstengreat great so feel free after i   have go through this information you know lori kirstenshare any information you might have lorimhm amywell i   will probably have a lot of question for you kirstenfrom your experience amyokay kirstencause that   be you know lorimhm kirsten usually the good way that we can get some good detailed information be from volunteer that actually work in mammal so we love that um clap anyway so we get the penguin our original batch of penguin from from this zoo in scotland and um you know as you know you ship them over and they go into a quarantine period and i do believe it be thirty day do   not do   not it   be in my literature right there i   will check for certain uh that be require by the usda basically there   be there   be a disease call n newcastle   be disease that be be very contagious apparently and so there   be always the potential of when you bring a bird over contamidate contaminate the poultry amy mm kirsten business okay and so that be th background information for the reason for quarantine um with our other penguin uh we bring them over from scotland and as it turn out in a quarantine period that they have that a vi or i should say a fungus okay this aspergillosis fungus have come to fruition and we have lose you know a good portion of penguin so amy wow kirstenokay now it   be time to consider replace these penguin how do we want to go about do that well really do   not want to go through transport the bird do   not work last time a potential for bring over disease be obviously there so the thought be okay let   be get some egg um sea world san diego have gentus and apparently just not enough egg to share if they have them they would gladly same situation with the edinburgh zoo they would gladly send us bird but they do   not feel that they have enough egg to send over so we really do   not want to go the bird route and so that leave us the choice of go down to antarctica and collect some peng some penguin egg ourselves so they go to and i do   not know if this be pronounce correctly wiencke island loriyeah that   be where a lot of seal be from as well donhm kirstenokay lorimhm kirstencool lorimhm kirstencool don that   will fit in with your class lorii know kirstenyeah alicenicole be here kirsten hi nicole nicolehi alicehey let me kirstenhow you do alicecan i just interrupt for one minute nicole oh okay alicecan i see your i would nicole mine alicei do   not think darren put anything on it nicole mhm alice right okay kirsten why do   not you have a seat nicolesure lori snort p oh i   be tired p kirstenso they go to wiencke island where a lot of seal be from and lorimhm amy lori nicole kirsten collected egg lori mhm kirsten okay so the process be i   be just gon na finish up on my story the process be be they um they go to the nest okay from our staff it be mark ryan from marine mammal and mike mulligan from fish and frankly i i   be not quite sure who the entourage of other people be but they go to the nest and basically wait for the penguin to stand up and check to see if there be two egg there amy hm kirsten gentu penguin and this isn be   not true of all penguin often when a penguin lay egg if it lay two one be small than the other gentus lie two equally sized egg okay um lorihm kirsten the reason i mention that be if one be small he would have go for the small egg okay don why kirsten because that would probably mean that lori female kirstendo you remember read in the exhibit for the rockhopper penguin downstairs they lay two different sized egg donmhm kirsten depend on the year and depend on the condition of light um if it   be a bad year or there   be just not a lot of food resource um environmental condition be rough it   be a stormy bad year lorimhm kirsten a penguin might lay two egg and at that point i do   not p i do   not really wan na use the word decide lorimhm kirsten that   be kind of anthropomorphic but somehow figure out at this point i   be gon na kick out an egg q loridetermine don ah lorimhm kirsteni   be go to determine through whatever amymm kirsten however it do determine to do so nicolehm kirsten will kick out an egg nicole kirsten otherwise it will brood the two egg and hatch em out it   be not uncommon that at this point they   will kick out the small chick don right kirsten if at that point condition do   not seem to be sufficient to support raise two of em it   be kind of like hey why bother lori mhm kirstenand kick out one of one of the chick if it   be a f great year on fat there   be food di it   be a beautiful day f donit   be call penguin euthanasia lori kirstenokay don kirsten donwh wh kirsten they   will they   will they   will try to raise both lori kirstenso lori kirsten i do   not catch that what wa donit   be call penguin euthanasia kirstensh lori kirstench wh yeah wh lori kirsten um so anyway apparently what th what they now at this point they want to see okay now be there actually a fertile be there a fertile chick or develop chick inside lorimhm kirstenand apparently it be very very muddy it be abnormally warm and it be just a big mudbath out there and they could   not they could   not clean off the mud enough to be able to see inside to see if if it be viable so they take an egg from nest that have two egg and i think this this report say within thirty one hour the egg be back here in chicago lori wow kirsten that   be pretty neat nicoleoh kirsten and then they take them to an l off site incubation area l in addison be anybody from addison i do   not know where addison be nicole i do   not either s it   be a west suburb kirsten west amy yes kirsten so they be out in the west suburbs and incubate there amy lori mm amy kirsten and apparently now they   be about six to seven week old nicole wow amywhen i be here two week ago they be sixty day kirstent s two week ago it be sixty day amyi think maybe it be four week ago kirsten okay amy yeah kirsteni think i think they   be around six week old lori mm kirstenokay but when you see them you   will see that they   be just about as big as number ten they   be big lori n kay amyyeah when i yeah when i be here they have they be lose all of their hair and they look the two old one look like ten kirsten right right so basically what the process have be be we bring them here as chick but they still have their downy feather okay so as they lose their downy feather they become eligible to go out onto exhibit and so what they do last time you guy be here there be maybe ten that be you know i say eligible to be out on exhibit nicole kirstenand what they would do be they would carry them in let them hang out for about a half an hour get acclimate to what be go on and then take them off and do this now they   be out now they   be they be out on exhibit don all of them kirsten almost all of em two day ago there be twenty five out on exhibit so we have thirty chick total donright lorihm kirsten so twenty five plus be out on exhibit don okay kirsten um thing of it be be let   be think a little bit about penguin natural history okay how how long do penguin spend on land don three month i think kirsten what   be your guess lori uh donthree or be it three to six month kirsten okay lori um four five kirsten six donsix kirstenokay nicolesix month kirsten so it   be it   be basically nicolewow kirstenit   be an even even split don kirstenbetween life out at sea and life on land so the sequence of event be they come on to shore springtime they hook up with their mate they build a nest they mate they lay their egg they brood their egg they hatch their chick they brood their chick they feed their chick they molt and then they   be out to sea so all of that have to happen within that six month period that   be a pretty busy bird lori nicole kirstenso don wh wh kirstenthe penguin need to grow the chick in order to be ready to go out there for six month out at sea really need to be very well suited for that don kirstenso they nee need to be big they need to be hefty they need to have their adult feather so amymm kirsten between the time that they actually hatch out and the time that they   be ready to go out to sea be just a couple of month nicole how long do it take for them to hatch kirsten well the incubation period nicoleor um to have experience kirstenis anywhere depend on the specie it   be it   be one month to two month nicoleoh okay kirsten okay so therefore you know basically between build a nest and mating and all of that other stuff you know they i would say that they have three month to to grow and get ready okay so they   be big now the funny thing be be that accord to mark ryan well hmm nicole kirstenor just interesting i guess go watch them um lorimhm kirstenif you watch the trainer they walk into the exhibit and they start throw penguin into the water and push them in and they   be all over the place um nicole kirsten they try to get out sometimes they make it sometimes they fall back in gentus usually dive in head first these guy be fall in amy kirstenjumpe in diving in so their behavior if you will be be really interesting okay lorimhm kirstenit   be just it   be just a lot of fun to watch them um they   be do something different with these chick than we   have do with the other penguin be that they   be try to feed them crill um yesterday i think be th be th be when they try it for the first time and that crill be about as big as lori mhm kirstenyou know from my joint up to the top of my finger here so it   be very difficult for a person to hold a crill nicole kirsten and drop it into a penguin   be mouth so very good f s food source for them that   be what they would feed on in the wild in addition to other thing so what they   be try to do be they   be throw the crill into the water and see if the chick   will go for it so they try it yesterday and they have some mixed success you know some animal be interested other be   not so y a apparently they they   will keep do this so do be they be   not do that when you be in there amyno no no no kirsten okay when they be chick cause what be it how do a mother feed a penguin chick lori do   not she bring food to it amy she regurgitate it kirstenshe regurgitate it lorioh kirsteni sh should   not say she cause mother and father share loriboth nicoleoh kirstenshare the duty okay but yeah they go out they feed and they regurgitate up the food and that   be how they feed the chick nicolemm lori actually other bird do that as well kirstena lot amymhm lorido   not they a lot of bird do amyyeah kirstenyeah a lot of bird do lorithat   be right kirstenthey never really do any well we h do   not regurgitate for them but lori kirstenthey start them off with um strip of fish and they actually dip it in a vitamin and um pureed crill batter lorimm nicole kirstendippe it in and then give it to the penguin chick so they   have be on solid food lori hm kirsten for quite some time and now it   be just interesting to see if they   will just go for the crill itself amyare they i mean be they be hesitant about it kirsten i do   not see it yesterday be the first time amybecause kirstenthey do it at eleven thirty and four o'clock where the amythat   be really interesting because i mean go from be hand fed kirsten right right so i do   not know so i would say if you   have get the time or if you wan na make the time to be down there at four thirty hopefully they   will do it again today and it   will be interesting to see so i   will find out from mark um you know what the response with that be loriso four thirty   be chick feed kirsten yes don be there any particular trainer work with the penguin uh hm be all the trainer allow to work with the penguin kirstenyeah well basically here um all of the trainer work with all of the animal so they rotate them around basically excuse me p so that the animal do   not get attach to one person because if that person decide to leave then that could be detrimental to the animal but we do have a lead a lead person for each animal lori kirstenmark ryan be lead penguin donmhm kirsten meg be lead otter lisa takaki be lead lag don lorimhm kirstengreg be lead seal so mark be basically call the shot for how the program   be gon na be structure so he   be he   be the penguin trivia guy so it   be a neat story lori mhm kirstenit   be it   be a very neat background story and i think you know for s for some of us underwater view gallery have not be your favorite place so this could this could bring new light to the underwater view gallery loricould be a gift kirstenand actually just give a new focus on the penguin we have   not do as much interpretation with the penguin as we do with the other animal so you actually have some kinda neat thing to interpret here as far as what   be go on some other thing that you might see the penguin segregate themselves the specie do   not intermix okay if you   have notice that before nicolemm kirstenthe rockhopper pretty much station themselves in the center the magellanic use to be off to the right doncough kirsten and then well number ten could do whatever she want amy don the gentu kirsten but nicolewhat   be number ten i k kirsten i   be sorry nicolei i k s amy nicolei k i keep go kirstennumber ten nicolewhat   be number ten here amy nicole kirstenkay the the penguin be number nicole oh okay kirsteneach penguin be number nicole kirstenand on on the arm lori wing don kirsten okay the the joint here well what do you call this donthe wing humerus p don hm kirsten at the humerus donhu kirsten we would have a tag lorimhm kirsten and they   be color code so if you be like to see well how do it work give me a number amywell they wear color when i be there kirsten okay they   be color but amyjust seven do they move em to number kirsten amythey be go to kirsten what it be be that green let   be say for example green stand for one black stand for two that   be number twelve amyis that how it work kirstenyeah amy okay kirsten so they number them so that when they   be feed them and they   be take down the record of okay number twelve eat five columbia river smelt and two nicole kirstencapeland lorimhm kirsten they can keep a record of what the animal eat okay so they do   not have name but she because sh because she   be the lone feisty penguin number ten have become kind of famous in the penguin world downstairs so it it it   be a female nicole kirstenth the only female gentu penguin that we have prior to the chick come in nicoleokay kirsten okay so um now you   will see that they   be segregate actually the gentus have kind of break up into clump and there   be from what i see yesterday three different clump um let   be see let   be g let   be interpret some of the behavior we might see okay what be what be a penguin stand out with its arm like this i should   not say arm its nicole loriwing amy donwing kirsten its wing nicolewing amy kirsten lori kirstenright lorium donperspire lori actually cool off doncoole off loriis   not it kirsten yeah yeah lorimhm kirsten so right here be where you do   not where the penguin do   not have a a dense covering of feather so if they wan na cool off they tend to do this okay if i be to see a penguin do this lift one leg up lori it   be rest be   not it kirsten what else could it be amy sleep no p nicole balance i guess kirstenit   be balance amy kirstenit   be do think trick nicole don amy kirstenum nicole kirstenactually it would be conserve heat okay nicoleoh donhm kirstenso the wing and the f leg foot lori mhm kirsten there   be no dense feather coverage on the on the leg so they might be conserve heat okay um if i see a penguin sneeze nicole kirstenwhat might be happen there nicole allergic to food kirsten amysick don i   have never hear a penguin sneezing but amy nicole amy nicole cold don kirstenokay don loriit actually kind of sneeze nicolei know could you hear it amy nicole how can you tell from it like shake his head kirstenyou   will nicoleor sneeze kirstenyou   will see him you   will see him just like what a person sneeze nicoleoh okay kirstenyou can tell donmhm kirsten when they jerk their head like that how be how do a penguin get its fresh water how do a penguin drink nicole oh lori i have   not study penguin in a while don do you know don no lori hm mm donfrom i think a way w drink from pool just kirsten they   will drink salt water donsalt water kirstenall also you know like the dolphin they actually metabolize the water that   be store in in the fat of the fish that they eat and that   be how they get their water source lorimhm kirstenbut basically you   have get ta separate the fresh water from the salt water actually just have to separate out that salt so they have a special s nicolethey have to do that loriso that   be how they   be do nicoleoh lorithat   be what they   be do when they sneeze be they   be get rid of the salt kirstensalt nicoleoh kirstenthat they have accumulate they have a salt gland in the beak and that be what separate the salt out dondid you know that before kirsten and to get rid of that salt they lorihm mm donme neither kirsten they sneeze lori yeah actually nicoleoh i never even think of that lorii remember do the penguin thing a year ago but i do   not remember that adaptation donno lori oh well kirsten um we   be gon na have to go up and do and a in three minute just look at the clock loriwho   be do kirsteni   am face the clock loriwho   be the diver kirsten i do   not oh probably bernie um nicoledo they have different diver every lorimhm nicoletime kirstenyeah every day every day p nicoleoh kirstenso that would be excrete salt um when i see a penguin pick its butt what be it do nicole amy lori preen kinda like pick at its feather donpreene preen kirsten okay loripreene kirstenit   be preen what be it do what   be at the base of the tail don kirstenthis be fun you guy don yeah right amy loriit   be at the nicoleit be fun kirsten don lori kirsten what   be at the base of the tail nicolei would not   have even think of these thing don well the anus be at the end of the tail nicoleit   be like oh do   not know they have meaning kirstenpardon me donright the anus be at the end of the tail kirstenthat be that be very true donright kirstenbut donbut kirstenlet   be say near the anus what might be there donwhy do   not you answer this question lorii get preen don lori nicole ah kirstenit   be okay lori it   be kirstenit   be the preen gland don yeah lori oh okay kirstenokay so it   be a gland that store oil so what a penguin will do be it   will go back it   will squeeze the gland doncough kirsten it   will get some oil on its beak and then it   be rub that waterproofing lori so it can keep itself waterproof right donmm kirstenwaterproofing lorimhm nicoleoh kirsten all over its feather amyhm lorimhm kirsten preen also consist of work an air layer at the base of the feather because air be a well insulator than water if there be water touch the skin lorihm kirsten water be like a vacuum clean it be just gon na suck the heat away lorimhm kirstenso by have the air there it   be a well insulator so when i see a penguin dive into the water and i see all of these little air bubble come out what be i see lori the air be r be don escape from the feather loriescape right kirstenis compress out lorifrom the kirsten ch ch so the penguin come up on land and let   be start again lorimhm kirsten and will start preen work that air layer in get some oil lori kirsten spread it out lori how often do the donmm lorihow d often do the bird molt kirsten lorionce a year kirstenonce a year loriokay kirsten some specie   will molt twice lori twice kirsten but basically if you think about it you know a year of pick at the feather the feather be gon na wear out lorimhm kirsten so the last thing that a penguin do before it go out to sea be lorishe its yeah nicoleokay kirstenit do a clean sweep lori mhm kirstenand molts all of its feather off and then get the new feather on okay so other than that um really the only training that they do with the penguin you know we train all kind of behavior with the other animal the the the the training that they do with the penguin be basically that they have feeding station for them donhm kirsten uh rockhopper ' be here uh gentus ' be here magellanic ' be here and you be not gon na get a fish unless you come to your feeding station lori do they pretty much know that by now have they pretty much adapt to that amy they be still in the room kirsten okay amywhen when i be here and they be they be pretty random about it because mark would take you know a bucket over here kirstenright and that be with the chick amyand then whoever yeah kirstenokay amy with the yeah i mean the one that be in there lorithe adult penguin amythey yeah the adult one be fine about it lorimhm amyyou know someone set up over here and someone over here and they pretty much go where they be suppose to loriso they know to go to station one amy yeah versus station two kirstenright amyyeah lori okay kirstenso i guess not i   be not i   be not sure but it   be just kind of interesting because other facility as far as i   be aware it   be like with the sea otter as well you know the training that they do with these animal be pretty minimal with the sea otter they   be pretty they can be aggressive they have big tooth people have historically do more training with cetacean than they have with other animal and we we really do some pretty unique training here with our penguin with our sea otter and with our seal lorimhm kirstenso it   be kinda neat stuff lori cool kirsten anything else about penguin that we should discuss for you guy the key to the penguin cart if you d well i do   not lori the puffin cart kirsten be yeah the donpuffin cart lorimhm kirsten be on be behind the tide pool on one of re the reserve tank so if you choose to pick a specimen you do   not have to bring the whole cart out if you

if they   be well take care of um a lotta horse will live into their thirty a a good way to compare horse age to human be to multiply by three and except i think the old liv oh old horse on record i think in the guinness book of world records be sixty two so do   not multiply that that one by three that would be what a hundred and eighty six or something be there any other question no if anyone   be interested in see what perry look like when he have his fourteen foot tail um when you come into the visitor center i do   not know if if anybody notice this there   be a tv monitor right after you where you buy your ticket when you come in and you look up and there   be a an ongoing hall of champion presentation on this tv monitor up there and uh there   be a little clip of imperator on there and i think he   be slowgaite which be his most beautiful gait um and you can see his fourteen foot tail up there and that be it be really beautiful do you have a question back there aud he want to know how you say hi to a horse debra um just say hi you can just say hi and they and you can say their name cause they know their name so if you want to say hi to imperator just and he go by perry so

great handicap horse to ever race he have also be vote one of the top ten racehorse of the century be a handicap horse mean that forego ha forego have to carry a lot of extra weight over whatever

laminiti which be a disease of the h of the hoof and and they put him down our next horse to come out today be our other thoroughbred geld to be retire here and you   will see that he   be a lot small than forego this be john henry john henry be the horse that come from very humble beginning he be by the stallion old bob bowers who be not much of a racehorse or a stallion either and he be out of the brood mare once double who outside of john henry have very little success as a brood mare john be bear on march ninth nineteen seventy five at golden chance farm in paris kentucky the farm keep john until nineteen seventy six when he be consign to the keenenland january mixed sale now this sale be not a very good time to sell a horse it   be usually when people try to sell the horse they do   not think be worth feed through the winter so because of his small size his lack of pedigree but most of all his very nasty disposition john bring only eleven hundred dollar and from the time of this first sale until may nineteen seventy eight john be sell over half a dozen time because nobody want him and nobody could get along with him but in may of nineteen seventy eight a new york businessman sam rubin decide it would be fun to own a racehorse well mister rubin do   not know anything about horse and the only thing he know about racing be where the valet parking be so he buy john henry over the telephone sight unseen for twenty five thousand dollar john then go to new york to his first trainer bobby donato in his very first new york start he win a twenty five thousand dollar claim race over the dirt by one and a half length his next race be on turf which john prefer to run on and again he win but this time by fourteen length well a group of horseman who know more about race than mister rubin do advise him to send john west where the turf racing be more lucrative more competitive and run all year long so in late nineteen seventy nine john head west to his new trainer ronald mcanally in nineteen eighty john win over nine hundred thousand dollar in nineteen eighty one john win the very first arlington million over one point seven million dollar and be vote horse of the year in nineteen eighty two and nineteen eighty three john have some injury and only win four race but they mount up to one point two million dollar and when mister mcanally want to bring john henry back as a nine year old folk be pretty skeptical about his chance of be competitive at this age well john do lose his first race that year but he go on to have his good year ever on the racetrack he win six grade stake include a repeat victory in the arlington million over two point three million dollar and again be vote horse of the year when john be retire in nineteen eighty four he be the world   be rich thoroughbre in history with earning over six point five million dollar since then alisheba have beat his record but john be still the rich geld john hold seven eclipse award which be second only to forego   be eight and be induct into the racing hall of fame in nineteen ninety john be also name the thoroughbred horse of the decade for the nineteen eighty john have be retire here for eight year now he be nineteen year old and stand a very small fifteen point one hand tall lady and gentleman the great great john henry many applause debra do anyone have any question yes aud the horse that retire here how much exercise and what kind of debraokay these horse be be not ride anymore um they   be just l like you say they   be retire they each have their own paddock except for sergeant pepper and imperator they we turn them out together because they   be friend and mostly they just hang out in their paddock and they graze and they exercise themselves they run around a lot and keep themselves in shape and that   be about all they do they get they get lot of treat and lot of love and s we think they   be happy but they still run around um just like young horse sometimes john will get out there and run around he   will rear up on his hind leg like silver you know and do and uh it   be real cute uh forego   will run around willie and his little goat will get out there and and run and imperator usually like to trot he do   not gallop a lot but he trot around like he do when he be show and it   be they   be real cute there any other question aud yes what uh the goat in with the horse be they just good friend debrauhuh that   be his little buddy they   be just friend he willie do   not really like other horse very well and and he like people but he   be not as affectionate as maybe perry or sergeant pepper so we do   not want him to get lonely and that   be his that   be his little friend originally they have get the goat for john henry when he first come to live here eight year ago and they put the goat in the stall with him he kick it back out and um so willie adopt it and that original goat die about a year ago and willie be real sad and depressed so they get him a new one our last horse to come out today be our standardbre representative ramble willie a standardbre race at a trot or a pace and they pull a sulky with a driver willie be a pacer willie be bear in monroeville indiana and he begin his racing career as a to year old for his owner raymond gibson he have four start with two second and two third so he do show some promise but mister gibson decide to sell willie as a three year old willie be sell to a hall of fame trainer and driver mister robert farrington for fifteen thousand dollar but not long after he buy him mister farrington decide he   would spend too much money on this horse so he call a friend of his from cincinnati ohio mister paul sebert and he try to talk mister sebert into buy a half interest in willie well mister sebert have own horse before and his luck have be pretty bad the first horse he own die before it make it to the racetrack and the second horse he own make it to the race and she run and run but just could   not win anything so he sell her and after he sell her she go on to win her next four start in a row for her new owner well mister sebert do buy a half interest in willie though and thing do   not start off so well there either willie be be race at county fair in ohio and indiana and be be beat on a regular basis well around this time mister farrington   be wife vivian be have a birthday and he be try to decide what to get her so mister farrington decide that a good present for vivian would be the other half of willie well vivian be a very religious person and her father at that time be the minister of a nearby church so vivian decide that if willie ever have any success at the racetrack she would donate ten percent of her half of willie   be earning to her father   be church and that   be when willie   be race career take off manylaughter debra because of his success and his tie to the church there be a book write about willie title ramble willie the horse that god love in order to promote his book willie would hold autograph session one day when willie be in new york he have an autograph session at macy   be department store and he be such a hit there that macy   be give him his very own charge card manylaughter debra well willie be without a doubt one of the tough and most durable horse to ever race he race from the age of two to thirteen he have an incredible three hundred and five start he win a hundred and twenty eight time sixty nine time he finish second and seventy nine time he pace the mile in two minute or less which be a record willie still hold today when he retire he be the richest standardbre in history with earning over two million dollar willie be our other senior citizen here at the hall of champion he be twenty four

at the horse park gift shop and we   would like to thank everyone for come to the horse park and to the hall of champion presentation we hope you   have have a good day and if you have any question feel free to ask us on your way out thank you very much many applause kristin well let   be kind of figure out a classic um diet uh quota for you and let me get a piece of paper so that we can write that down envdeskdrawer paige kristin the way we do this paigeyeah kristin be first of all we make a a guesstimate of how many calorie typically that you would need d we we do   not do this last time do we paigehm m kristinokay alright yeah i think we be gon na wait until we cause you be gon na change some thing maybe after you see doris so first of all we make a good guesstimate of how many calorie you need and that   be always a tough one um paigemhm kristin most woman unless you work out a lot you probably be   not burn much more than like eighteen hundred to maybe two thousand calorie paigemhm kristin so what we can do um i would say i   be gon na go ahead and make it out about eighteen hundred just because uh you   be at a good weight you   be about five five um i think that would be a prudent place to to start out from i know i wo   not uh cause you to gain weight and you probably wo   not lose any either but uh paige kristin okay so we   be gon na take eighteen hundred calorie paige uh h how um how many calorie do you think i   be eat now or can you even tell that kristin paigefrom look kristini could do a calorie count um on that but i   would actually need more amount paige although you would   not be able to tell because there   be no i do   not write down like the fat and thing like that kristin well if if you give me real specific amount like i have you know one quarter cup of soy milk half a cup of cereal paigeyeah kristinthen i could paigeoh okay kristin i could count your calorie paige i see kristinand and figure that out and run it through the computer and get a printout paigemm kristin paigehm kristinof your nutrient ratio and everything paige wow kristinfor the day in fact if you wan na do that i   would be glad to run it for you but you   would have to take one day paige mhm kristinand really paigeand write everything down yeah kristin be paige kristin like precise paigeokay kristin um okay so eighteen hundred calorie time point four that   be gon na be forty calorie or excuse me um forty percent of your calorie come from carbo hydrate and that   be doris   be standard protocol really paigemm kristin okay time point four give us seven hundred and twenty carbohydrate calorie paige yeah kristin then we divide that by four paige kristin calorie per gram you   have paige kristini know you   have see this before which give us a quota of a hundred and eighty gram of carbohydrate per day actually i should   have do that paigemm kristin okay then we have to distribute it paigewow that   be low kristin yeah paige that   be not that much kristinit be paige kristinthen we have to distribute that into a an ideal ratio now you always do have breakfast really unless you   be run a bit on the high side paigereally high yeah kristin and you always have some kinda lunch pretty much and you always have some kind of dinner paigewell yeah kristin basically paige kristin now the mid morning snack the snack be hit and miss that   be where we maybe would h have to to look at thing a little bit more closely but usually lunch and dinner be your main meal and we would give you about a thirty percent quota at both lunch and dinner which be about fifty four gram at each of those place paige hm kristinwould be sort of your ballpark quota and it   be not outlandish like here you be sixty four well a little bit higher um paige mm kristin here well you be about uh forty fifty nine sixty four so sixty four fifty that be seventy four so it   be a little bit high be what you   be use to do paigemhm kristin and um paige kristin yes paigeyeah i remember like a long long time ago let   be see uh it be i guess forty maybe forty forty five seventy or something kristin okay paigethat   be how they have it divide up kristin okay paige i think although that   be m more right let   be see kristin tsound pretty high paigethat   be yeah kristinyeah paigethat   be what a total of a hundred and kristinit might   have be base either on a high calorie level paige kristin or a high percent of your calorie come from carbo paigemhm mhm kristinlike if this be fifty percent paigemhm kristin which be probably more realistic for how you eat paigemhm kristinbee a vegetarian you eat more and we can change it up but we   will use this as a base and then we wan na compare it paigemhm kristin to what you typically do and the thing be if you start do this right now you   would have low blood sugar paige right kristin cause you   have already adjust your insulin paigeyeah kristin to another level paigemhm kristin but i think what you could learn from this be that um at least if you sort of choose a standard place for a while paigemhm kristinuntil you get thing a little more stabilize it might be easy to do your insulin paigemhm mhm kristin and then um once you y be a little more comfortable with that then you can start do this flux with paigeright kristinadde the unit for another ten gram say if you usually have sixty four and you find you know ex unit of insulin work for that paigemhm kristin well then you can jockey it from there now at breakfast we often keep that down around twelve because paigetwelve wow kristinuh percent uh paigeoh kristin point one two time paige i think you mean gram i be gon na say h where do you find food that   be that low kristin well paige kristinsome people actually end up have to do that that   be only about twenty two gram paigezero or something kristin because of that dawn phenomenon paigemm mm kristin so that   be not much at all then paigeyeah like even an english muffin be too much kristin unhunh unhunh paigeeven oatmeal kristin it   be it   be really difficult you can either have either or sort of a thing let   be see sixty seventy two okay so that give us a twenty eight to distribute throughout the rest of the day and um make a decision of how to do that really involve your insulin now in the morning you   have get a good amount of regular insulin that you take paigemhm kristinso i would wan na put a little bit high percentage for your snack there like paigemhm kristini would say maybe even ten percent here um paige see i hate that snack have to eat snack kristin oh paigei just do   not have time kristin paigeyou know kristin the only trouble with that be paige kristin at breakfast you just wo   not have your insulin there for you to eat the big carbo breakfast typically paigemm kristin unless you run high after breakfast and then it come down when the insulin finally do get work paigemhm kristin but then you   be run high paige mhm kristinand that   be you know that   be the only way to protect yourself paigeright kristinis yeah you eat a bunch of carbo you take a bunch of insulin you run high for an hour and a half paigeright kristin and then all of a sudden it come skyrocket down paigemhm kristin when all the insulin get on board paigemhm kristinso um paigeright kristinanyway uh point one okay that   be just gon na be eighteen paige i wonder how kristinroughly there paige how do doris do that though because she like i do   not think she eat lunch or anything i mean kristin paigeshe just like have this really minimal dose of nph i think kristin you   would have to ask her paige that   be what uh kristini do   not know paigethat   be what i suspect kristin i do   not know the trade secret there um but uh h you know i think probably um keep the carbo a little on the low side enable of course then you   would need less insulin which make life easy paigemhm mhm kristinit do make it easy if you do eat less carbo cause you do   not have to take these big amount and then wonder what they   be gon na do and when paigemhm kristin um this actually sometimes make it more complicated now mid afternoon you be take a touch of regular at lunch but you do   not really eat much of a snack usually after lunch cause you have a late lunch might have some cheeto there i see paigemhm oh that be just cause i be like kristinum paige could   not eat dinner kristincashew paigehm kristin um paige kristin paige i have to go to something like right at at six o'clock or seven o'clock or something kristinso that really may be one paige kristin where it   be sort of debatable you know maybe at the most you   would have five percent there um and i   be just sort of guess as a place to start uh why   would i do that i know what it be and that   be just hardly anything that   be a f some a few nut really and that   be about it or um then later on you do sometimes eat after dinner cause you   be kind of a nightowl and um paige kristin let   be see this   will go twenty two plus uh so we   be look at about roughly thirteen fifteen percent there so okay so approximately well s essentially like breakfast so those would just be place to start from papertear but i think um what   be even more important paigeokay kristin be you   have get ta tailor it to what your insulin be and use these as a jumping off place you know if you say well this be ridiculous i always have a seventy carbo dinner paigemhm kristinwell so what you know there   be nothing wrong with that it just mean you slightly adjust that insulin same thing if you do   not like snack what be you gon na do to compensate paigemhm kristin for the fact that there   be there   be a lotta insulin there maybe and um paigemhm kristin how be you gon na get around that um but that   be the sole purpose of snack be to really prevent low from happen and to counteract um the insulin time action um so paigehm kristinm paige oh kristinmaybe we should compare paige kristin go ahead paige oh i just have one question so for example kristinunhunh paigesay i do   not eat lunch then what would happen like then i could not take the insulin there kristin paige and then kristin well paigebut then i do   not know kristinyou probably would need to eat a little something paigei wonder i would get high then maybe hunh kristinbecause of your nph peak paigemhm mhm kristin although you do   not take a lot of nph so paige in the morning yeah kristin it may be debatable if you really need to have something later in the af uh or b to get you into dinner okay um paigehmm kristin you know you might have to eat sort of an afternoon snack if you do   not paigemhm kristin um or yeah take look at look at the nph that you   be take and y doris could help you with that do she give you a scale for a w no lunch lunch scale paige a w while ago but um it change after that see this be the original thing that i have she say but okay this be hm this be a while ago see three twenty four ninety four so um like for example she have these two thing so if i be gon na eat like say i i decide ok in the morning i be gon na eat lunch then i would take four unit of nph and then supplement it with the regular but if i know like say in the morning that i be   not gon na eat lunch then kristinhm paigeshe say take but this do   not make any sense to me take six nph cause i would be low with this then definitely kristin paige you know kristinyeah paigein in the afternoon kristinhunh okay yeah paige i think this be kinda guess kristinwell paigetoo cause it be before kristinhm paige i have really kristinyeah definitely um you know check with her on your insulin cause you know she be the only one that can really clarify them um you know just it   be tough to to do the jockeying of of the food and the insulin it really um paigemm kristinit it just it make it really um a a challenge there to paige well this be where i get the idea that she d probably do   not eat lunch well i do   not know how she would have time anyway every time you see her it   be like you know five minute here five minute there but um then also just like um i do   not know she sort of like know what i mean when i be say kristinunhunh unhunh paigeoh it   be such a pain to have to stop and eat lunch kristinmhm paigeyou know and so um that   be where i get that idea but kristinmm mhm well it   be yeah let   be see and so four of n six of n and then zero regular there paige yeah kristinhm that   be where just monitor monitoring monitoring um paigemhm kristinlet you know if if it   be gon na work for you or not if it   be too strong or not strong enough paigemhm kristinum yeah yeah paige right kristinso it   be well anyway how can i how can i help you with all this paige kristini feel like uh we   be still in a pickle in that um it   be just every day be so different paige kristinand paige kristinyou know you   be you   be adjust your insulin paigeright kristinuh per your uh protocol that you have there and the carbo be vary around that um but you know i think it   be important we make some kind of a a goal to prevent these low from happen paige mhm kristin and uh try and prevent the one that be creep up a little bit too high and you know what do you think um that uh you could do to h clarify this a little bit more and paige oh kristinmake it a little easy paige well i guess maybe if i try this m maybe that   be the only way cause it seem like to me that um i do   not know p i do   not know it   be maybe it   be easy if i have like some kind of set thing cause then kristinyeah something to shoot for paige yeah kristin kinda paige cause otherwise i   will just do whatever i feel like do kristinright paigeyou know kristinright paige kristin uh paigeobviously kristin well you you could give this a try as far as the level but what i would do be be use what you   be currently do as sort of a backup guide because obviously if you   be have and and this have change a lot uh over the past few day but um well one day you have thirty eight at breakfast the next day you have none um paige yeah but that   be like if it   be high kristin forty paige and it also like sometimes i just write em in different column cause kristinokay paigecause uh depend on what time it be kristin but if you   be have only you know around and what you could do be sort of round these a little bit like shoot for say twenty five or paigemhm kristin just say every morning you   be gon na have a thirty paigemhm kristinlike a thirty gram carbohydrate brekfast period paigemhm kristin that   be um it it would work and then you just start learn from that paigemhm kristinyou know you know that a thirty gram carbohydrate breakfast would be an improvement on what you be do as far as drop it down a little bit paigemhm mhm kristin and yet it would be s it would also be something kind of easy to do with toast or bread paigeright right kristinor english muffin so you could just lock into that and uh see see how that go um uh mid morning well that   be kind of a debatable one cause you do   not really like to have the snack paigemhm kristin but try it and see maybe carry something with you and it could be something simple you might make this just sort of a a plastic baggie full of cracker that you take with you wherever you go paigemhm right kristin and just make it a standard habit paige mhm kristinor it could be a piece of fruit that be gon na be approximately in that ballpark and lunchtime i i would say maybe round it i might round it to sixty so so what if we increase your quota up to about forty five percent paigemhm kristinit   be not a big deal that that   be not the most important thing the main thing be that you   be try to hit those quota consistently paigemhm kristin um here i do   not think you   will have any problem eat something later on after dinner paige kristin if anything it   be it   be gon na be try to maybe keep this down paige mhm kristinaround fifteen to thirty or something in that ballpark paigemhm kristin but i agree that if you can make it a little more rock steady you should be able to smooth some of these thing out a bit more if you have a schedule that you   be try paigemhm kristin to to go for but these be a little bit more scientifically derive paigeyeah mhm mhm kristinbased on what insulin be do a a and when paigeright kristin so paige yeah hm kristinquestion uh paigeno i   be just i be just look at this number and think br oh br if i only eat that amount of carbohydrate at dinner kristin paigei   will be just like drop kristin paige you know all night long kristinwith your paigeand and that be so annoying it   be like you have to keep eat and keep eat cause i   have have that happen kristinwell maybe realistically what you wan na do be keep this one because lunch well what be you gon na have really you   be gon na have yeah a couple tortilla or maybe a sandwich or something along that line paigeyeah kristin maybe realistically this be only about forty or fiftyish paigeyeah kristin okay so that   be fine i would just adjust this to fifty or forty five or whatever you see fit paigemhm kristin but dinner you   be right you have control in that you have a regular slide scale that you can use and maybe b realistically you should make this seventy paige mhm mhm kristinand just but but call it seventy and then really try to stand by that and look at the insulin look at your number before and after and what do happen over the course of the evening um do you have to go ahead and have this within two hour or paigemhm kristin uh or what paigemhm kristinbut but look at it and see but stand by it make it like seventy and then just stick to it paige mhm kristin um paige okay kristinso paige okay kristinso anyway that   be something you could play with for uh a little while and see if if it um help in get rid of some of the outlier that we   be try to fix up so um other question uh paige kendra what   would you do sabrina sabrina nothing i leave the phone in my bedroom last night and so i   be ground from the phone yawn it be an

educate cam mm lajuan you have a hard time decide on what   be a good school what   be a good curriculum for you to take your your parent be   not able to talk to you about it w just as you be say even though you   be not black but you be just say that but black child have that even more so camright lajuanbecause you har you   be you   be more likely not to be ha come from educated parent whereas i come from an educate family it be just the fact they make us do everything on our own and cammm lajuanbut black people also th those that have more try to teach you to be strong but i think they instill s try m try to make me so strong that they forget that i be a person and i mean like i i often feel like at time that and maybe it   be the gayness come out in me but i do   not like it like and when i be home just go home to indiana i go to hug my sister and i still feel that she find a coldness in hug cam she do   not like to hug lajuan no my family   be not very much hugging cam oh lajuani mean my whole life we   have never be very you greet someone you do   not s hug them you   be just like hi how be you and even like male female you do   not do it cam see uh my my mother be like that more so lajuan cam and then my father be different lajuan very emotional very hugging camyeah very hug they be just see my family be more lajuan camit   be it   be different it   be like lajuanmm cam each member of the family be slightly different and different a amount of touch lajuan i always say that if i have child i would always especially if i have a son i would hug him just so he know that i love him camright i think it   be important i think it   be good lajuan cam i do   not think you can overly hug um with family and stuff like that lajuanyeah see and that   be how i feel be that i want to hug him because i want him to know that i do love him cammhm lajuanand that i i i want my child if i if i ever have child to know that there be nothing wrong with show physical affection between two man it do   not make you gay cam right lajuan you know and that be one of the thing that scott be say yesterday it really bother scott a lot because his nephew uh keep call him aunt scott because and his nephew be just be rude and obnoxious about every gift he he unwrap and his brother say oh that   be just the way kid be today and i   be like no that   be the way you train your kid if you do   not train your kid to be any well then they be and see and in scott   be family like his brother his old brother   will say oh scott   be my good friend but he   will tease scott about oh why be   not you marry you know you must be a fag or this and he   will laugh it off and he do   not realize well yeah scott be gay and it hurt scott cam he do   not know that he   be gay lajuan hm mm cam lajuan have no idea he   be probably he   be gon na drop him off which be why i have to close those blind soon but uh it it   be the way he be and his brother be just like that and so he and h and so his little boy be grow up the same way larry   be twelve and he   be like this big kid cause he   be overweight and i tell scott i say well scott i would   not take it personal cause scott be tell me this morning i say first of all larry   be twelve year old he   be like six foot one and he   be fat i mean he   be just probably a good two hundred fifty pound i say camhe   be six one at twelve lajuan at twelve year old camoh that   be scary lajuan and he   be like two hundred and fifty pound and i say scott he   be compensate for the fact i say i bet you the kid pick on him i say he   be different i say so therefore he probably be a big bully at school and i say so he   be probably just like this kid who   be just like real bitter because nobody and i say his dad be just an a a jerk scott   be brother will call our house and just be just rude to scott but yet he   will turn around and ask scott to borrow five thousand dollar i mean like he just borrow twenty five thousand dollar from scott like two year ago and tell scott oh i   will give it back i   be gon na invest it and i   will give it back in three month so he give scott it take him instead a year and a half to pay scott back like w scott   be get twenty five thousand dollar just to lay around like that you know and that   be the way his brother be you know very and he   be just he   be just mean to scott he say thing to scott just like oh just awful thing about gay and camwell why do   not scott say something lajuan because scott have   not deal with his gayness himself and he have   not deal with who he be cammm lajuan and that   be why he do   not say anything cam so you ca   not really blame the guy in the sense that lajuan camhe do   not know he   be hurt him lajuan if scott do   not stick up for himself camright lajuan and i keep tell scott cam lajuanyou   be gon na have to say something cam lajuan because all of these thing be hurt you cam yeah lajuanand scott   be like oh it do   not bother me and i   be like then why be you talk about it i say i if that would have be my nephew and he would have say that to me i would   have knock him across that chair i do   not care how big he be cam lajuan camoh yeah lajuan i say my nephews d my nephew and niece do not one of the little girl cam lajuanf uh try pull something on we go shop and try the little attitude in the in the mall and i grab her and i say i do   not care if you be my sister   be child i will knock you across that bench in a second cam lajuani say i do   not have to take that cam lajuan i just it   be you will never go shop with me again cam lajuanum i just do   not believe in it and i i i   be sorry i be not hit as a child but i also be not nasty like some kid now he   be right they do talk bad some of the kid say thing but kid always do but that   be not an excuse envphonebeep camexactly lajuan envphonebeep lajuan hello hello what   be wrong cam it   be jimmy p lajuan why why okay alright wel yeah if you do   not have enough gas and you   be worried that you   be gon na run out i would   not go anywhere either so why do   not you call i   will call you later on okay bye env phonebeep lajuan he   be afraid that he   be gon na run out of gas get over here camwell why do   not he get gas lajuan i do   not know he drive all the way back from green bay with just on that and he think he be gon na like make it and somebody would be open and i   be like so he say he   be like it   be he say it   be like past empty it   be past the e and so he   be afraid that he   will run out on his way over here and he probably would cam oh well he should just go to a gas station lajuanso he say he   will well there   be one down the street from his house but it   will probably be open tomorrow morning cam oh lajuanit   be not open now so he say he   would just rather stay home instead and i say fine go ahead and stay home cam lajuan but i do   not know i i really think that it it   be hard cam lajuan it   be hard it   be it be hard have to hide this like scott   be do i could   not hide it any longer than he have he   be hide it way too long cam yeah lajuan camno i could   not hide it that long either i tell my mother when i have like my boyfriend move away she s lajuanis that why you tell her cam mm cause i be really upset and then i s and then she   be like well it   be a good thing he move away cause he be sort of effeminate and i be really offend lajuan that   be how she take it cam yeah and i be really offend cause she say something like lajuan camwell it   be a good thing he be sort of weird i do   not like you hang around him and i say what do you mean he be weird and she say he be sort of effeminate and i be like well what do you mean he   be gay or something she   be like well i think he might have be and i say well why do that bother you i say because i be and she   be like no you   be not i know you you   be not gay lajuan cam and i say yes i be i say how do you know me better than i know myself and she   be just look at me and she be like really upset lajuandid she tell your dad or do you tell your dad cam no she end up tell him i think eventually but not right away first thing i have to go to see a a psychiatrist lajuan oh she make you go do that cammhm i go lajuan oh jim   be mother tell him that too cam see and then i go and the guy   be like really nice and he   be like well what what   be why be you here lajuan cam tell me what   be what   be go on and i say well lajuanhow old be you at this time cam nineteen lajuan and she say that   be for the psychiatrist at nineteen she do   not think you know enough about yourself at that age cam right well she do   not want to believe it you know lajuan yeah cami guess you ca   not blame em some to some extent so then i go to the psychiatrist and he   be like well what   be the problem and i say well my mother   be upset because i   be gay and he   be like well it sound like she have a problem then lajuan do he really say that cam yes he say it sound like that she   be the one with the problem and i do   not even think about how i say it i just say it you know and he interpret w how i say it as how it be you know w which be true lajuan and you know what   be really funny be that a psychiatrist would say that cam lajuan and knowingly know that you know he accept the fact that yes you be gay that it be something that like when mike tell his friend julia mike be tell me that julia say oh i do   not like it but if that   be what you want maybe that   be not truly who you be you know and i say to mike i say then mike she do   not accept it and he say well i think she accept it she just say that and he tell her that he feel he be bear with it and she say no i do   not believe that i think it   be your choice that that   be what you want and i say to and i and i tell mike i say you know i hate when people say that because if i feel that be my choice i do   not think that would   have be the first choice i would   have pick cam oh god no lajuan and it   be not to say that i   be ashamed of be gay camno lajuan what it be be that because of what society have do or have lay the rule for us i do   not really think i would have choose to be gay cam lajuan i i would   not why would i want to be gay and have to deal with what we go through cam exactly and that   be what i explain to my folk now and lajuan cam and they totally believe that it   be lajuan cam like hereditary or genetic or whatever that it   be not a choice you know because lajuanthey do believe it now camoh yeah they totally b lajuan oh i believe it   be it   be i do   not know if it   be hereditary i do believe it   be something it   be a gene or it   be something camright lajuani i do   not think i do   not care what people say you you be you do not choose camunh unh lajuani   have know since i be gosh probably i can remember four five year old cami remember that yeah lajuani remember look at my uncle be sleep on the couch in our family room and he be sleep there with his boxer on and his peepee fall out of his pant and i just stand there and stare at it and i be cam lajuanand i know it be a sexual arousement cause i can remember feel sexually interested cam lajuanand so i be like four year old so i know then you you know what you feel inside you you c you ca   not camright lajuan and i do   not care what anybody say a a f at four year old i pick i choose that that i like what i see i do   not think so i do   not think i know at four year old that i could actually just say oh wow i wan na play with this guy you know camright lajuani do   not think so and and if they say thing like oh when i be maybe seven i sleep with my cousin tommy who be probably twelve thirteen at the time and i sleep with him no he be sixteen share a bed with him and he uh start fondle me and i enjoy it and i fondle him back and i be like seven year old and i i do   not say that he do it to me he molest me or r or rape me as people be say now the old uncle generally i think these kid cam hm lajuan not say adult should   have be more responsible my sixteen year old con cousin should have be more responsible cam lajuanand not play with a seven year old child but he do but i   be not gon na turn around and tell my aunt well gee your son molest me as a child cami he gay lajuanno cam he   be

get marry and he have kid and stuff he have kid which do   not mean anything there be a lot of fag with kid but he just be very that be what happen to me and and i do   not blame my cousin it be just another awakening experience for me i mean there be several experience when i be grow up i mean i remember watch one of our neighbor who be take a shower and you could see right through his bedroom and he get out and he be naked and i remember watch and i remember be mesmerize by his body i be never really that mesmerize by a female   be body as i be by a male   be body and so camright lajuan that   be why i do   not understand where uh they come up with this of it   be your choice it   be not i i know that that   be what i feel cam well i remember when i be li i be like probably three or four lajuan camand i be wrestle on the i th i remember wrestle on the floor lajuan cam with my brother and be arouse mhm just like goof around and stuff like that lajuanmhm cam and then i think the l

happen and he say i do   not want to talk to you you take advantage of me when i be drunk but he   be the one that grab me kiss me take my underwear off and he start it you know i know what i be about i do   not get into it but i know cam right lajuan and he be the one that be the first experience and then the second experience he do   not speak to me for three month because he blame me for that and then the third experience he blame me for he   be be blame me for all of these experience up until uh like scott and i get serious like the year after and i be still kind of see darren i go out to washington and stuff and that   be when he stop blame me now he call me and tell me that he want to be with me and he call like he call me last week and say he want to be with me cam you   be kid lajuan no but he   be married to lauren and i keep tell him get out of that relationship before you have child just get out of it do   not carry any by baggage with you always my big theory do   not carry any excess baggage cam mm lajuanwith you and he love her but what he do   not know how to separate be he love her but he   be not in love with her you know what i mean he he just camright right oh yeah lajuan camyou can love a person but you   be not in love with them lajuan camit   be not sexual lajuan yeah and that   be really hard cam lajuan because cam lajuan you you find it very difficult to be to love someone and when you tell someone you love them they misunderstand what love be all about so i do   not know but i d i i think if there be ever anybody i truly but he k he everybody have that one person who break their heart and he break my heart just incredibly because i be   not really in love with his look i just i   have never meet anybody who when you they touch you just there be so much warmth and so much just there be so much energy there that i mean cam so you   have keep in contact with him lajuan mm p yes since nineteen yeah cam that   be amazing lajuani   have be here for all this time cam what do he just call or you call p when he   be p lajuanno he call me i ca   not call him cam oh lajuan actually i can cause his wife know that we   be friend but i do   not choose to call him he like he use to travel around the country cam lajuanthey live they use to live in valencia california cam lajuannow they live somewhere they just move cause his wife get a new job he quit his job for her for her job cause she move to california for them cause they be live in washington dc so he use to travel all around the world well whenever he come to wisconsin for the dairy expo or he   would come here go to chicago for some reason to take businessman around what he do be uh he take f uh farmer around from arou different part of the world so that they can look at farm so his travel a lot of time be in wisconsin because of the farm here they would see how thing be do and he he like take them around the world you know do this and he travel all over the world see that   be why i think darren now be get to this point where he   be with lauren all the time and before darren travel like ninety percent of the year he be go i mean darren be go ninety percent of the year so now he   be with lauren every day and it   be be this way for the last three or four month and i think k camoh that   be all for the last three or four month oh lajuanhe just start stop they   have be marry six year he just stop travel camoh lajuan and i think now it   be just like i do   not know if this be for me i do   not know if this be right and he   be start to call me and he   be start to tell me how much he care for me and how he have feeling for me and i i know that you   be with scott and i   be just like and i   be not give up my life for you he ask me once right out of college when he move to washington dc when i come back from california and i be here and i have just start work he ask me to move to madison to be with him that be when he be on the peak of think maybe i be gay and i say well why do   not i come out there first and we   will see so i go out there and he go well yeah you can move out here and get your own apartment whereas he own a three bedroom house and live by himself and i   be like okay can i afford to move out here get a apartment until i find he never say move in here with me until you find a place or whatever it be just like and then he want the still straight life and this and that and other so now he claim bisexuality but he   be move closer i think to step of be gay because when he be talk to me on the phone last week he be tell me how much he still love me and he do   not know what to do about this whole situation camhow could he really love you though he do   not know you that much lajuan he do   not know me because in the last ten year we talk to each other maybe once a month cam well that   be quite a bit though lajuanand actually maybe not even that sometimes it   be every other month when he be travel around the world like he go to germany for six week and he send me his frequent flyer ticket cause he be there train to t speak learn to speak german in a six week course and he send me cam lajuan a free k to to come and spend a week with him and i say no but at that time i would been with scott like four year and i be just like i do   not think so you   be not gon na use me for your little sex thing for that week and then that   be it so i mean i st i love him i really do but camhm p lajuani do   not i also do   not trust him i do   not think any man who be as sexual as he w be and travel as much as he do could stay celibate or or stay t t commit to his wife cam right lajuan i mean when y i see him once in chicago i go to chicago about four year ago five year ago and he be in chicago in this really nice hotel and he say why do   not you come and you know i   be free saturday and sunday why do   not you come and i say fine so i take the train to chicago on saturday and i think okay no big deal he   will have a room with two double bed no it be a king size bed so i think okay no big deal i take a sleep bag just in case so here i be take my sleeping bag i roll it out on the floor and he go well you do   not have to worry you can share this bed with me i love lauren and no i take that back it be more than five year ago because he   be be married to lauren for six year this come may no seven year this come may so it be more than six year ago because it be when he ask lauren to marry him it be right around christmas time so it   be be about six and a half year so he ask lauren to marry him and he say i really love lauren i   be gon na marry her and blah blah blah this so i get in the bed i think fine no big deal i   be wear my t shirt and my underwear so i get in the bed and in the morning i wake up and here he be fondle me so i   be like okay so do you leave or what do you do you know so i   be like darren he go just do   not say anything and i say darren this be   not right you do   not really want to be with me you just want the sexual part and i say that   be all there be to it and i just ca   not do this and he accept it and i i do   not know he always and he   will always ask me well how   be scott how be your sex life with scott be you happy with scott you know do you still miss me and i   be like well darren i have   not tell you i miss you in year what be you talk about cam lajuanyou know it   be like k excuse me cam be he like full of himself or what lajuan and he   be another one too cam lajuanhe know he   be good look he he   be another one when we be be in college he know it cam mm lajuan and and what really get me be th that i think the reason i always attract like i attract a lot of football player be people always get the impression i be gay so if they know you be gay and they want some experience and they they do   not want to approach another say man in your frat and they kinda think you be gay and nobody really want to like say it they would approach me cam mm lajuan so i always get all the good look one to always like come after me cam mm p lajuanand that   be how i end up with ron and how i end up with darren and i and i realize that you know i always think well especially ron i mean he be just like oh just perfect well darren be too but darren a lot of people do   not like auburn hair or reddish brown hair they do   not ca care for it but ron just be just a just a beautiful man they both be but i find that that   be what happen in these fraternity be you find a man who be curious about his sexuality and if they find someone who they question okay be he gay or be   not he gay then they will tend to go after you a little bit faster so then you think okay you   have see some of these guy in the bar and you think like i be out at the triangle and i see this guy he be so good look i   be like cam lajuan how the hell do he end up with that thing and then i think you know i betcha he   be just out and he be from marquette and he be just find out and he meet this guy and that   be why he be out with him camoh lajuanyou know i mean camwhen be this lajuanit this be probab this be a while back this be camthey young lajuan yeah well the w camoh lajuan they be young the one guy in particular be young the guy that be from marquette cam mm lajuanwa probably i f i would   not think he would be more than twenty twenty one i could   not but he should   not have be in the triangle if you want to know the truth so but um no he be just very nice patrick ow corinna be he still a virgin patrick uh corinnajust out of curiosity patrickhe buy a hooker corinna patrick but be he a virgin when you know him corinna cough i mean have he ever have a girl where he do   not have to pay her patrick oh oh he get like i tell you about the time he get like a blowjob at the lakefront corinna no you do   not patrickoh no way um well what happen be i be just me and janine well let me back up here i start hang out with janine janine and i get smash and we like make out at the lakefront i do   not need the detail corinnaby the way i see the janine last night patrick oh cool how   be she do corinna okay patricki have   not see her in half a billion year so um but anyways we be like make out and stuff at duncan lakefront so that   be what we regularly well not regularly do this like th two three time

slight pressure reedyeah give it easy easy yeah do   not darren that still hurt back here reedyeah yeah well you do   not want to stretch see what happen you st ch accord to this other guy you stretch your ligament in there and the ligament be the thing that hold your joint together keep it from flop around so if they get you know stretch just a little when they try to peel down and tighten up and you do   not want to you know get em too lax while they   be try to tighten you know you want to let em heal as strong as they can i mean you can move it i   be not say you got to go around with it just totally but you do   not wan na stretch those ligament very much when while they   be heal just just gradually bring it around darren okay reedare you use any kind of walk aids darrenhm mm reednope just walk around hunh darren yeah i have for the first two day i have a crutch or two reed okay darreni switch from two to one like a cane and then i reedyeah okay darren uh it be really icy there so i it have a spike on it so i reedoh that be neat darren yeah peg it in the ground reed if you forget and walk inside with your spike i guess you   be not too well appreciate darren no reed bet you darren no reed let me set you up there darrenis it okay if i record this i i already have reedsure darren it   be for a project reedsure sure darren cool reed alright what be you do over there i think you be do something different i think you be work with language in darren oklahoma reedhunh darren or in california reedi mean well yeah y california your basic project darreni be in linguistic that   be what this project   be for reedyeah that   be darrenbut i do a year of it and decide it be   not quite what i really l reedquite quite what you want okay darrenyeah it be an unfortunate cause i really do   not know quite what i want reed well that   be alright i mean there   be a lot of thing out there you   will find something darren i hope so reedyou know darren i move to oklahoma reed completely my son be still flop around he he uh graduate from medical school this year and uh i mean he   be in uh soho in new york darren really reedstarte an art career darren reedso so you see i mean a lot of people you know i mean he   be gon na paint for a year and just see whether he can do well enough with that to darrencause he do   not want to be a doctor after all reedwell he could   not find anything he really want to do you know i mean he darren do he specialize at all reedhe well that   be what i mean no he have   not specialize yet but he could   not find anything that just really pull him toward it and so he say well you know i guess he get a lot out of always do art when he be young and he   be get ta scratch that little itch i think darrengood for him reedand so he   be up there and he   will give it a year and see what happen and the same for you you get you get plenty of there   be uh fortunately this day and time i think it allow one to proceed like you   be and you   be proceed and he   be proceed and i think it i think it   be the right thing to do i would   have d i would probably do the same thing be i you know another generation down the line you know although i r i do   not make the wrong decision for me but i   be sure i would have be a lot more uh uh i guess diligent in in work it out beforehand but in in my time you know you really kinda just there be   not too many thing to do you know and you too many opportunity and so you just kinda choose between a few and that be it darren yeah reed darren reedso a little simple lifestyle in those day tell me where it hurt darren uh still a little bit back here reed mm kay darrendoe   not feel quite normal back there under reedokay darren it originally hurt reedon the side yeah the side do   not hurt much darrenit would not anymore i think it do at fir reedmm kay darrenat first reedgreat darren he draw some blood out from here the first time reedyeah i see that you get a little bit of blood not too much that   be a good sign too cause usually when they   be tear bad they have a lot more blood than that be that do anything darren nothing bad really reed which one hurt more back or forward darren they   be about the same reedabout the same darrenthere   be just this sense of constantly not be quite right reed mm kay well see let me show you something over here watch this one see i   be push back now darren yeah reed and i   be pull forward and it you get a little bit of pull come forward it it move out a little bit and but when you go back it kinda tight it   be get a good catch to it you know darrenmhm reedover here we   be gon na pull pull it out darren wow it do   not have that same movement reed it   be get a little more forward movement and it kinda have a kind of a rubbery kinda end stop there so uh chance be you   have uh hurt that uh ligament in the back too uh darren the crossband reed mhm yeah the call we call em the cruciate ligament he call em the ex band or whatever they be darrenyeah i do   not know what reedth they they cross and one they cross because one   be go forward and one   be go backwards and they keep you from go forwards and backwards be basically what they do so darrenhunh reed pretty logical arrangement there darrenmhm reed yeah it be your posterior   be mess up a little bit darren well can that get well reed uh mm get a little well maybe p it   be not gon na get all the way right darren mm reedit   will be a little bit of a problem i   be not sure you do   not maybe have some of that before i do   not really know uh let me see w how much this hurt here darren mm ree none darren mm mm reedgood darren my main physical activity for the past year and a half have be aikido env doorclosing darrenwhich be a pretty gentle art reedmm mm kay darren lot of roll lot of the knee do take something from that i believe that they a lot of work on em reedoh yeah sure any of those thing get ta put some kinda stress on your leg you know darren i definitely want to get back to it though i have to lay off it for a while that hurt right over here sallyokay reedmm kay it   be not too bad though sally reed it   be just very mild uh that that one could probably see look at the difference on here now what see see how much of a jiggle you get there you get just a little laxity there right darrenmhm reed and this one   be just a hair different i mean it but it hurt darren a bit reed uh a little bit darren it hurt a lot at first reedbut it   be just a hair and uh so if you just let that one kinda heal you know which i think it   be gon na do cause you do   not even complain much of this over here you know when you   be do thing you   be think more about this back one and that   be the posterior ex band if you want to put it like that or posterior cruciate we call it darren reed uh seem to be the problem but it   be not uh i   be not sure you do   not have a little bit of that problem before darren it be   not all these year since the wreck the the leg   be never feel you know like it it   be never be totally normal but reedmhm mhm darreni just get use to it reeddid your knee do your knee feel like it would darrengasp sorr that hurt a bit reed where do that get you over here darrenagain yeah reedright yeah okay that   be okay do your knee feel like it have some play in it you know it be   not real steady darren i do   not remember that be a reedbee a complaint while you be do your martial art stuff sally reedstill hurt a little bit too darreni injure the front of the knee when i be dance for a while i be dance with kristy hannah here few year ago and reedmhm darren there be some time i come down on it and it do some reed darren but that be impact injury reedyeah right let   be see how rough that be let your knee down alright now straighten your knee out yeah you   have get a little put your darrenyeah reedput your hand you feel it darren yeah it   be reedbut that   be pretty typical how about this one you get anything over here darren i   have get a reedno that   be pretty slick just a little click over there darrenyeah reed alright uh hold your leg real strong there let me pull on it and let   be see if we get a pretty good muscle there be that hurt anything darrenmm mm reedkay alright well i i think uhm you know i i think probably it   be mostly posterior cruciate not so much anterior cruciate which be good um the medial collateral ligament that ligament here be just minimally hurt uh i think some of that posterior cruciate be probably already r there and the reason i   be say that be because it really do   not hurt that much when i pull on it see the this be the one that pull on that darrenit feel tight though a bit reed mhm when i push back i   be push on it that   be and and that   be not bother you very much but see this one have be hurt and when i pull on this one darren that do hurt reedy it it hurt so i mean you know i mean pretty simple you know if if they   have be hurt they gon na hurt when you stretch em you know so that   be why i   be think that posterior be probably a lot of that   be be there you may have hurt it a little bit more you know and y so you get this one a little bit and this one a little bit both of em be a little both of em can probably heal up if you let em and darren no need for surgery to make it well reedno unh unh and uh the the outcome will probably be pretty close to what you have before in other word i darreni may have lose a bit but it   be not reedyeah i mean you know five percent or something you know what i mean you know i do   not know you know you   will just have to try to have to see how it play out but it it   be gon na be minimal and you can z you can overcome that a little bit by get your muscle in well shape there be two thing that stabilize your knee this be your knee brace the big muscle above your knee be the brace for your knee that   be what hold it together when you   be do thing in fact you know all the sport player they their ligament have be stretch so much and repair and stretch and repair that they they   be just not much good and they really have to compensate with their muscle power be what they do darrenthey do a lot of leg lift reed so right uh you know just just uh you can do straight leg lift or what we call just those little short extension just put a bolster under behind your leg right here extend the last twenty to thirty degree with weight on your leg like this do little short extension with weight darren mhm reed and keep work up on the weight darren mhm reed you wan na b you what you wan na do and you can just do isometric you can just lock your knee real stiff and just tighten your muscle hold it tight as you can for three second and then let it rest for three second and then tight for three second and then rest and you do   not have to move it when you do that uh all kinda way so just whatever the day will al permit i mean if you   be sit around and you get some time to do some isometric you can do that and then when you have other time you can do the weight but keep this strong will compensate for your ligament be the plan you know so uh you know i think i think you   will find you you do pretty well darren do you think i can go back to aikido and stuff ree probably as long as it   be not too too violent you know it   be more form and shape and stuff or it   be it   be not too much contact darrenit   be about reed darrenbut no it   be ideally it   be about blend it   be about blend with the attack it   be not about meet the force with force so reed okay darren there   be a lot of roll reed okay mm well i guess if you get good at at do it you know where you do   not be   not get yourself in awkward position and you know get your knee all twist up underneath you or something you know you could probably handle it okay i think i think you   will you   will be able to see for yourself because once you get your muscle strong you get this thing control your knee well you   will see what kind of knee control you have it   will be pretty obvious to you whether you you have the type of control to do that darren what do you think the lesson should be from this i mean this be the first time i   have ever be on skis i never do it before my wreck so i guess the less w one lesson be i   will probably should   not try skiing anymore reed darreni reedhe you know if it be me personally that would probably be the lesson i   would learn from it darren cause i   be lucky it be   not bad when i reedright darren it be a pretty bad fall reedright darrenthe the incline be about i do   not know what grade but there be a turn in the wood it be this be in the woods reedyeah right darrenand it be cross country reedyeah darrenso i do   not know what i be do my girlfriend have teach me i have be ski for two and a half hour i be tired reed darrenand we be get close to get back and i get carry away she show me how when you   be in cross country when you   be about to fall you just sit down reedoh okay darrenbut i do   not do it right so there be a turn and then i and the ski do   not snap off of course reedoh i know darrenand so it stick and i keep twist reedyou darrenand the knee take all the torque reedoh darren and i do   not know what i   would do i scream and she help me and i manage to somehow i do   not know s somehow manage to get up and hobble on the ski pole all the way back to the cabin reed oh my god darrenand then we have to call the uh s the ambulance to take us sixty kilometer to oreille which be a ski resort reed geez darrenwe be in the middle of nowhere reed hunh darren i   be a little i i think it   be be three week now i i be hope that you know you tell me or doctor smith tell me that you know with chronic osteo it could come back from impact and i be and i really hope this be not the time you know i   have make it how many reedah that   be unlikely darren i   have i have not spike any fever or or see any sign of reedyeah no it   be it look pretty good darreni think i may have get lucky reed yeah if it   be not hurt up there the pain would be probably your first warning sign and you know darrenif that ever happen reedright you could start feel some change in the the status quo you know change darreni still feel reed yeah darrenit feel b pretty much like the other leg i mean reedgood that   be great wonderful darrensolid reed great darren well reed love it well i   be glad you do   not hurt yourself it   be a cheap lesson right darrenthat   be right reed sally darren i   would say so reed yeah i i be out we be out and the kid be ski you know and i be watch em go down and i wh be think god that would sure wh be fun you know and then s just barely my common sense win out and i decide not to do it but you know i   have have two disc take out of my back my neck fuse for a bad disc i do   not need to go flumpity bump down the hill you know i do   not need any of that so you just have to have to kind of draw a few line darrenmm reedbut i come close to darren it   be tempt reedto try it it   be tempt it   be very tempting darrenit be fun i can tell you till i fall reedoh god it   be it   be just great you know but then i   would have to pay for it for the rest of my life but i do   not know whether i want to do that darrennot a fair trade reedcough not a fair trade sally no darreni would   not do it reed ch darrenthat   be bad odd reed good to see you come see me you know whenever you   be in town darreni will reed and uh let me know what you get into i   be sure it   will be something fun darren i hope so reed i think it will see you darrenbye bye reedokay sally okay just let us know if you need

say danny right now um cindy yeah i do   not really know darlene but so other than it look kinda tacky they just get all kinda planter and all kinda crap pile outside they do   not they have   not get to the point of put their old water heater out there or anything like that there   be one house when they start all this we somebody get a list of the house on this one um subsidize thing cindyunhunh darlene and me and about five other people drive around to all these house to see what they look like cindy darlene and about half of em be as nice as mine or nicer s keep up you know m then some of em have well uh landscape but you know like i keep my lawn mow and trim and all that about half of em be as good or well than mine which that   be fine cindy yeah darlenethey they i think they be do a real good job the other half they long weed and stuff be the least of the the problem this one house have it look like an abandon junkyard it have so many old appliance and break down shit out in the front yard i do   not know what the what the thing be cindy but you find people do that darleneif they be my neighbor cindythat all all i mean i hate to say it a lotta time the people in our

good place for em to get out of the sun or get out of the cold cindy yeah that   be true darlenebut evidently that one house i i go by it about a year after that and it be still the same way bad bad cindyhm yeah darlenemore thing cindyit get darlenebut cindy i do   not know darleneuh i guess uh i wish i could think of the name of that other program see this one guy at the store have a house that he buy and then he could   not afford the house payment anymore so he get with one of these um support thing and uh like hud and i ca   not think of the name of it and they guarantee him a residence cindysection eight be you talk darlene section eight yeah cindy yeah p darleneand it work out good for him otherwise he would   have lose the house eventually he get it back you know he take it off that and he get his finance back in order so he do   not lose his house so it work out good for him on that and he say the people that all the people that have rent his house he say section eight that uh section eight people keep up good with it and check on the people but on this other program it do   not look like they do cindy yeah darlene so anyway cindyhunh darlene but cindy so what do you get

really be his employee for the purpose of this job mitchellthat   be correct he have em all fill out the plo proper form judge so then your cost would be reduce there as far as mitchell that   be correct judgealright mitchell uh i go to receive my check of which we have agree that he would deduct the amount of the hourly wage that he be judgewas this agreement in writing or verbal mitchell completely verbal i   have be work with him for like six year uh upon a reve uh uh receive my check uh for about two and a half week of work approximately between fifty and seventy hour i be pay three hundred and sixteen dollar and fifty one cent so i approach him with it and he hand me this yellow piece of paper here and note that what the employee make and uh at twenty six percent less deduction on these two employee which be the employer contribution so i note to him that he be suppose to pay that he say uh n no you   be gon na pay it so i say that   be not as per our agreement he say yes it be he hand me my check roll up his window and drive off and he   be there to state he   be he see that and be witness to that i have a letter judgei don i do   not think it   be relevant that he roll up his window and drive off mitchellwell i know but that that be the end of our thing i try to contact him everything finally i uh contact my attorney i   would like to present this letter to you here judge okay if i may look at that and have you show that to uh mister collin mitchellyes please yes he have he have receive a copy of that letter judge now stu roberts be an attorney be that correct mitchell yes sir judge you   be uh mitchell i   be his nephew judgeyou   be his nephew p and you   be nick ro roberts ' nephew too then mitchell that   be correct judge okay so uh your uncle then write uh builder uh a letter that   be what i   be read now mitchell yes sir judge uh i do emphasize that i   be read it this be not evidence this be only y your story that you   have tell mister robert mitchellthat   be correct that   be correct judgeokay p so really the dispute then boil down to this twenty six percent mitchell that   be it sir judge okay mitchell that   be the reason why i have him fill out that portion of or he want to write those check be so i would save that money so i would do that job judge okay mitchellat the end of the job judge mister collin i know you   be bite at the bit there you wan na say something so why do   not you go ahead matthew okay thank you your honor um uh pretty much um what mitchell have state be untrue mitchell uh do do some work for me out at the college we do the anacapa residential hall and this be a eight thousand yard job that we do this summer it require us to employ oh five or six crew uh mitchell roberts be one of them that we use on the job uh mitchell express a desire to do the work out there he express he do not know how to handle the payroll most of the uh contractor here in town that be independent like mitchell do   not know how to do prevail wage statement matthew the college be a state fund uh uh remodel and on state fund remodel we   be require to pay prevail wage uh prevail wage that um that indicate different level of agility of the different man work and so uh a lot of the crew uh like mitchell who have people that work under him around town in regular situation come to the people like me and ask us to do payroll for them when we do the payroll for them we state to them up front that uh we will pay the payroll we will make the deduction and then the employer contribution which be approximately twenty six percent over and above the hourly wage be also deduct from the um subcontractor   be check judge now this uh th twenty six percent that   would be be social security and what else would it include matthew um judge sorta like um mitchell that   be anything above that matthewwell you have you have matthew you have that i have a breakdown here of what we pay mitchell   be man judge matthewif you   would like to see that judge okay i mean do yeah y you get a total of uh seven point six five percent employer contribution on the matthew um that explain it pretty well there   be quite a few deduction of course judgeoh and and the oh the the f the annual unemployment insurance and uh matthewright judgeokay matthewworker   be compensation judgeright matthewfuda fica et cetera now that   be um in any payroll deduction situation you have the employee contribution which be deduct from the employee   be wage gross wage and then you have the employer   be contribution which be over and above that matthew which the employer have to pay now the agreement that we have make with all of the um subcontractor uh mark preston   be sit here which be testify for mitch roberts also do work for me and he be treat the same way we pay him we take his deduction out as well as that and so we uh do that with everybody judge okay wai i wan na make sure now that would be fine if that be the agreement now you say that the w you under you explain that to mister roberts matthew uh yes sir before he go to work judge okay mister roberts do you have any conversation mitchell absolutely not judgewith matthew collin about that mitchell the reason and i stress this and i do   not like to waste the court   be time but my total i agree if whatever he just say right there be true with withholding and everything judgeright i   be mitchell that be fine judge it really boil down mitchellbut judgewhat what be the discussion the agreement regard this mitchell the discussion judge mitchellthe agreement would be that he would pay everything so that i would   not judgedid he say everything mitchelly everything so that i would   not end up make after fifty hou fifty hour work which i know i be gon na make when i have to play my em part of an employer contribution i have my own payroll service they do all that for me and they   be very familiar with all type of pay this be why i do   not wan na take the job to begin with judge uh i can u mitchellhe in turn judgei can appreciate that now mitchellokay judge mister collins say he deny that you say everything right he just mitchelli would not   have i would not   have do it matthewwell judge you have a different story on what the agreement be matthew right um uh karen here uh do all the payroll and uh she   be here to testify about a conversation that her and mitchell have in our office about this very thing and i   would like to judgebefore or after the agreement be enter into matthew after the agreement be enter into he have be on the job for about a week or so and it be time i believe for the first or second pay period for his man uh he come into the office and have a conversation with karen about a the payroll and b this twenty six percent that we   be talk about and she   would be happy to tell you judgeokay madam why do   not you please explain the conversation you have with mister roberts karen okay um he be we be go over the wage for phil nigel who be one of the gentleman on there as to how much phil be to get for the job on an hourly basis and he have mention to me that he be want him to get ex amount and i say okay if it   be ex amount to phil then plus twenty six percent mean i take out this amount from your check and he go oh well then no i do   not wan na have the you know take out that much so we be go back and forth with the figure and so finally this be the uh wage that we come up with which be thirteen fifty to phil karen and then have seventeen dollar an hour take out of mitch   be check mitch roberts ' check and this be the note that i   would write down on that and then you can see that thirteen fifty plus twenty six percent which be three fifty one would actually equal to seventeen o one and i say matthewwhy do   not you show him the note karen you know just the seventeen be fine judge oh this so d do you have that conversation mitchelli do   not i have that perfect conversation with her and that   be very true exactly what you say but she never tell me anything about this twenty six percent that be come a come out of my check why it   be go ahead mark i be offer matthew offer me i   be mark preston i   be a licensed contractor also and matthew offer me the same situation and it be my understanding that he be to pay everything supply the glue supply and take care of my guy and make the payroll and pay all of the employer   be stuff if you   be an employer you get ta pay the stuff you get ta pay all the extra thing judgebut you do   not have any y you ca   not testify cough judgeunless i   be wrong about the conversation those two have you be   not there be that correct marki know for a fact that mitch be mak matthewhe be not there markm and he just mention that he matthew just mention that he deduct the same out of my check he do not i work strictly by the yard and i pay my people prevail wage judgewell any agreement he have with you be not relevant to the agreement he have with mister roberts markwell i see the people   be check and i   be just draw a pi verify what mitch say h ma mister collins be suppose to pay everything mitchell he approach him with the same markfir f f with the exact same thing and he d jerry stillman he do the same thing he do the same thing with marco villaremo who   be all license contractor judge but i still i still do   not know mark judgethat may have be on other case the question be do he do it in this case mitchell he it would be if it may please you uh the whole reason why i   be here be because he take that twenty six percent out that he tell me he be   not gon na take he use it as more or less bait me to do the job and go ahead and withhold it from me without say a word to it i have nothing i be expect to make about a thousand dollar on the job judgei understand that mitchell and when he write my check he write my check to me hand it to me through a window say that   be the way it be and th and and you know it be   not and he totally evade me he have to this day evade me judge mister robert that   be beside the point what i   be try to we have to really hone in on what be the agreement not how he pay you mitchellthe agreement be judgeif he mitchell that judge you know i do   not care if he fold an airplane and ma and sail it through the air mitchellhe would pay all my employee that be the agreement everything judgebut he di he dispute that mitchell well i understand that that   be why we   be here your honor judge wh okay wh but you   be the plaintiff you have the burden of prove your case that   be the problem i have be you   have get ta convince me by a preponderance of evidence that what you   be say be true mitchell well then if judgemore more likely than not now you say one thing and he say another mitchell then when when a person fill out or have other employee fill out the double u two form and everything why would i become liable for that contribution when h when he in fact by law be now employ those employee he   be the employer i be do nothing be   not there a law that state that fact when you have uh people work for you and fill out specific form to the state state that judgetell me again wh what be the what be the agreement again go go through the y conversation as you see it mitchell conversation be mitch if you do this job i   will go ahead and pay all your employee and you in turn will be able to pa make more money judge that be pretty much it mitchell that   be it that   be to the point judgeoh so he in effect say mitchelland that   be it judgei will pay your employee mitchellthat   be correct and he do sir and then when it come to the employer contribution without my knowledge or anything until i receive this check he just yank that right out of my check judge and mister collin that conv tell me about the conversation you believe happen matthew well um mitch and i um mitch have come to me and say he would do the work out there but he want to do the work under the basis that i pay his man and i tell him about what i say earlier here judge about the twenty six percent matthewyes judgethat be mention to him karenalway matthewoh yes uh always it be mention with karen here on her note of nine two ninety three that she write down her note that she talk with him radio twelve fourteen matthew and at uh at every juncture he be uh make aware of the uh the contribution be make by the employer these be his man and we be do a service for him under this agreement that we have between us judge now just just seem from a logical standpoint i be   not there obviously it seem like if you have say that to him he would   have say wait a minute it   be not worth it to me mitchell that   be correct judgewould you would you think he would say that matthewyes i would think he would why would he do the work judgeokay mitchell so you would trick me into do it tho judgewell not if he not if he say to you mitchellno but then matthew mitchellthen with all my with my fourteen year experience why would i do that amount amount of work and knowingly for over fifty hour of work judge well i mitchellknow i be gon na take him three hundred and sixteen dollar to do it judgethat may be a like a buyer   be remorse so i uh i do   not mitchellwell that   be not i have fourteen year experience in the trade that   be why i turn the d the job down to begin with without do any work at all judge well i   will tell you if mister roberts ' testimony be correct he should win and mister collin ' testimony be correct then he should prevail mitchelland i agree with you judge now mitchellbut the fact remain that i would not have do the work for this amount of money that   be why i turn the job down to begin with that   be why i   be here in the court today to make the court decide it should   not it should   not be legal for guy to do this judgewell i   be gon na make i   am gon na make uh in my mind a bad decision today now you both seem very truthful and honest i be   not there mitchell but i   be the one that   be bear the burden of this monetary amount judgeyou have to bear the burden prove it but mitchell i understand that judge i   be gon na award um mister robert three hundred fifty dollar approximately half now mister collin may not like that now y if he do   not like it then he can go ahead appeal it across the street superior court run the risk that he might face the full amount of seven hundred and four dollar matthewi will appeal judge okay but i   be go to get it and award mister robert three hundred and fifty dollar and if neither party be happy maybe there   be an old saying in court that both party be unhappy the judge make a good decision so matthew thank you your honor judge make it for the uh plaintiff of three fifty there   be some judgeand i will allow the court cost of twenty dollar and thirty cent i think there   be some paper up there mitchell thank you your honor cynthia um any of you who find that you really enjoy storytelle i would like to mention that the last weekend in july in spring grove illinois there be a festival

of education and go after it and we be cut down in that direction and it worry me a great deal now one of the wonder of america however in spite of the bad thing several year ago tony prieto uh who teach ceramic i think at mill college he and his wife go to europe to learn and we he rela turn he say europe share nothing america share and because america share our craft movement have grow so wonderfully we   be do wonderfully inventive thing in craft uh i have be very fortunate myself i   be not naturally a craftsman but i   have have four very wonderful craftsman to help me uh luken at usc the natzler otto and gertrud natzler great potter when they first come to america gertrud natzler would sit by me at the wheel and help me try to see what throwing be about then my colleague in ojai vivika and otto heino they   have be so generous they   be teacher they pass down everything they   have help me and uh i remember toshiko takaezu her name   be so hard for me to say be visit me she spend a day and a half help me center on the wheel all this sharing in our school amongst craftsman themselves be a wonderful thing so the movement go on and of course our museum be so important i do   not know if military minded people hope nobody from the fbi be here manylaughter woodif our military people if uh realize the importance of museum museum protect all the great art the great invention the creative effort of man from the beginning of time and they   be our inspiration and i think our museum be do wonderfully now even though we   be begin to cut down on education i uh i feel about the importance of craft of bring beauty craft into life one day i say to vivika heino because i   be a snob about art ever since a child i   have be drag through the museum of europe and america and my eye be expose to great art so i say you know it   be a mistake to teach cr pottery in high school the student have   not time to make anything beautiful and important and vivika heino so wisely answer that be not the purpose it open them to aesthetic and that   be what right education do now i wonder we have a tremendous population in prison and it   be grow we can hardly house them why we put the cart before the horse we put people in prison why because they have not have right education in the beginning and right education be the basis of everything now ha i   will end with one other idea and then you can ask me question and that be this since there be an olympic of athlete why not have an olympic of ethnic and tribal dancer from country all over the world then people could come and meet they   would have beautiful costume friendship would be make and i do   not think we can have peace just with gun peace come through friendship and friendship would be make with all these dancer intermingle and even dance with each other because when you touch you do   not shoot many laughter applause wood and i base this on a little experience of my own when i be in uh uh ojai as a sweet young thing i would go dancing at the art center i know all kind of square dancing folk dance nobody care who we be dance with if it be the rich rancher or a man take care of trash nobody care as long as he be a good dancer and after perrot woodevery month we have a party and all of us mix together in friendship that be wonderful and something like this could happen if we have great dance so i come back my last word be violence never end with violence and right education be the basis of everything many applause perrot well i do hope that there be someone from the fbi here

could you explain a little bit about bring art to the prison your thought about bring art to the prison f wood i think it   would be wonderful uh i   have always be concerned about people be in prison but i really do   not know very much i just think it   be a terrible thing that we have so many in prison and i   be sure we could s what be call save the life of endless people if they have a creative outlet but what be a young person to do bring up not know in any way right from wrong no compassion see bing bing bing gun use all the time no money drug why should they not steal now i do   not know if this have any value it   be personal when i leave home i make a very unhappy marriage in name only but the man it be a disaster and i be for quite a few year without any money and i mean i sell w my own book to get money to eat i know what it be to be at zero i be not train for the world i do   not know how to relate to the world but uh once a week i always go back to see my parent and

really jerk him around bentonokay and then spring the hip up nickspre your hip take a high collar grip lug if he   be bent over that far you would   not start off like that now you can just swing all the way around and grab that arm bentonokay nick just no bentongroan nick there   be no such thing as a hane uchi mata you fall straight on your face benton oh nick alright you do   not have the outer pull go for you you still do   not have enough outer pull he oughtta be wind up on his tiptoe way out to here now spring your hip bentonokay nick spring your hip billgrunt fall nickthere it   be hard too for you w your leg be so short and he   be so tall try it again and martin if your hip joint be okay benton yeah nick he   would b be just perfect for you to okay for one thing you   be back in benton okay nick watch from here bend over clap from right here benton okay nick jock him into it benton mhm nicki   have get ta still jerk him up on his tiptoe to throw him from here see that half

be gon na come to here now i jerk up first then i spin around benton okay nick and i   be gon na let it go god you   be heavy then i   be gon na let go here here see how i get you wound up benton fall nickdown here this be not a good throw to throw lug in nick i would suggest do this throw on combatant and opponent of equal height and size lug would be much well for a sode makikomi but not a hande maki hane makikomi cause the hane you add that spring alright i   be have to use my leg to throw his weight instead of use sode makikomi bentonfall grunt nick and get the outside of his leg and i can make that a pretty throw alright and with the makikomi technique with it you do   not have the tsuri komi the lifting pull that you would normally have you do   not have your right hand to help you with it all you have be an outer winding pull with the left hand it   be get ta go up out and around let   be give it a try throw throw bill again nick now spring the hip bill grunt fall nick that   be well jedyeah p nick much well now let   be throw it again and not have to stop and think about where the foot go now just one moment the more acute angle that that knee get at the more power w you have with your spring from your hip joint from here even if i   be do hane goshi if i get that that knee bend at ninety degree right here well i can blast him from here bill fall nick i   have get a lot of spring with it also lie the instep of the foot toe extremely well pointed to the inside of his calf i mean his his uh thigh at the bend of his knee i do   not care if your heel slide up into his crotch for a a hane makikomi now uh hane goshi i   would prefer that you do it a little bit different but hane makikomi the high up it get the more spring you get yoshi benton be this the right position here nick your knee need to be bent now pull pull pull pull and spr and spring spring benton okay i   be just try to get this bentonthis middle position nickalright watch even though he   be bent over i still have to get in benton okay nicki   have get to get him load look at his look at his heel be his heel up benton yes nick alright from here now i   have g i   be get to be low come on back side of the hand billgrunt fall nick and then i spring him off if he   be bent over it   be extremely hard for me to get under him with a standard tsuri komi grip well this way i   be just scoot my butt in there on him it do   not matter if i hit him a little bit above my his obi with my buttock as long as that leg be automatically cock as it go in then i   be throw my weight straight forward bentonokay nick with that outer winding pull it   be all important jerk him around in a big circle bill fall nick okay everything be there but the leg bill go into uchi mata i might have to have you throw uchi mata a couple time so you can throw a hane goshi think of it as a very short inverted kick like that you know how you can use slap invert kick up very close range bentonmhm nick that   be exactly what you   be do kick the inside of his thigh benton okay nick this time do an invert kick on the inside of his thigh when you do it go into it and load him up two or three time uchi komi alright bend your knee as you go in too you   be just straight and straight and lock kneed there   be well now throw benton nickrelax relax and throw bill fall grunt nickbetter better you   be still slide up that leg you   be not spring it bill let   be see you throw a couple time throw me it   be hot in here thank you billokay it be nick now i   be gon na be a sucker and watch your foot this now

reach for the mat he   be in there and wind up nickyeah jed he   be reach for the mat with this arm and your arm   be way up here high you   be like way up high off the ground and your sensei be way down like this by the time he get to the end of the throw see the difference so you   be wrap and you   be think i get ta make this throw what be i gon na do and nick be go for the mat with this arm he   be into a f almost like a forward roll mode the other difference that i notice between you and your sensei be that this foot be way out here this the your nick be they try to throw over the entire hip section jedwith th mhm and and and and when nick throw it so pretty like he do he   be get the his foot much closer to the middle of his opponent   be center of gravity bentonkay jed s you   be so wide that if you lift up when you lift up to make the spring motion what happen be you fall this way real quick nick that be it jedand you do   not have enough to go like that try it one time reach for the ground with your wrapping arm uh uh uh bentongrunt billfall nickbetter there jed yeah it   be well reach nickbut jed reach reach way into the ground with this one nick here here here   be it   be right here jed reach way like this like you be do a front roll out nick jed and and stand on this foot so that you be more balanced just a little bit more but you you   be go down i mean nickstep in when you have his b right between his leg no step deep jed wo   not settle nick step deeper benton okay nick look how d now get your foot over here bit more nickstep right between his leg benton that foot nick now shoot your arm and and kick jed oh nickf ho hane makikomi f woo benton ah so nick try it again alright you notice the difference in the foot position what hi what how much that help benton mhm nick step directly between his leg with your advance foot no no no no no bentonah nickyou   be not not between his leg jednow reach that arm reach that arm nickshoot it jedreach that arm through bill fall jed the more you reach that arm through l let me add one let me add one thing to it to make it cause it be a hard fall if you   be throw it contest style if you   be throw it demo style somebody once tell me that that the way to practice all the makikomi waza be to go down like this to take this foot if you   be throw right hand throw and to take this foot and stick it all the way through like this nickyep jed and just stick it all the way behind you like this and as you go down and you roll like that okay and if you do this in demo uh in demo fashion you   will be so low to the ground by the time that your opponent hit the ground that you   will be real nice to him and that way i mean you can intensify you can always intensify throw slap throw it harder but the mark of a good judo throw be to be able to do you see the people throw seoi so nice they can do they could throw their grandmother and it do   not even hurt wh she go ah that feel good wh so you can do that nickmm jed by stick that leg all the way through just like that as you get you follow what i   be say benton yes sir nick you do   not have to drive em through the mat jedthat that   be a way that you can practice it over and over in a demo style and be so low to the ground that it   be a real nice it   be about as good as you can get a makikomi for your uke it   be really not that bad and you could it   be it   be nickthrow him and let him see jedalright alright s so we   be come over like this come in like this fall jed alright nicknice easy clean fall look how tight he be to my chest look at his body position right here there be no you could   not slide a postcard between us benton i do   not think you   would even do it between the hip to to get the hip jed well do you wan na do

particularly you know yeah so many place in a short time that you get em mix up now we can ' t even keep our photo straight without the diary oh yeah well you know y when you get back from your trip until you make another trip you can remember but have take as many trip as you ' ve take shit they sorta run together i ' m talk about they do the one that be five year ago honest they do to separate the trip that you go on this one f it ' s tough to do and uh but they   be a lot that ' s a lot easy than a diary then you can transcribe it but uh i don ' t take i don ' t take my diary in the

ve talk about this on group for year all the problem we get with the black i be just read an article i believe it be the paper this morning where i read it maybe it be new york times yesterday thirty three percent of the black juvenile in their twenty be either in jail on parole or just release thirty three percent and then i i read in another art and that doesn ' t count how many get away oh that ' s right but that ' s of the in their twenty i read an article within the last three or four month and i ' m i believe i ' m correct on this figure that twelve percent of the black male population of the united states be e in prison twelve percent e of the black male population as you say how many di you know how many oughta be in jail probably that many more but the point i be gon na make be and there ' re always exception uh not to take anything away from uh percy jones whose article i read this morning because i mean he   be i don ' t know what his family have but i mean he ' s you know he ' s he ' s c he ' s he ' s come out of it but by and large across the board they ' ve just never educate themselves come from these background well that ' s the hard part and and yet you s they haven ' t educate themselves and you see these people come here from e taiwan korea cambodia ing taipei parent can ' t speak english they come over not speak english and they they excel scholastically in the most difficult subject i mean chemistry physics medicine i remember one year there for at the time i remember read the article it ' s be ten or twelve year ago but fourteen be fourteen uh public and private high school in shreveport bos i don ' t know how many there be today p i remember that it be a big article that five valedictorian for shjust shreveport bossier five valedictorian that year be of oriental descent you know couldn ' t   have be at that time two hundred and fifty family in the whole damn area no uh you know and you think you know um and you think about the jews the irish and the black and it ' s the same all over the fucking world mm and i just read an article in new york times yesterday i clip it for my wife to read uh about the fact that in israel where they have bring in thirty thousand where do the dark one come from ethiopia ethiopia uh and five hundred thousand russians ha very proud of the fact that they ' ve be able to do this in a country of five million people uh which would devastate most country i mean they uh it ' s ten percent the and and the the ethiopians in particular have a big march last week because they ' re second class citizen the jews look down on them too you know they get a they get a they get a uh a class situation they look different they and course they haven ' t accept the russians too well either uuh although the the the russians a high percentage of russians be accord to this article uh be scientist doctor engineer mathematicians and they ed educate the difficult way on area score score higher on the test than the than the th the native born but there ' s a big you know there ' s a the the there ' s a there ' s a there ' s a class differential which be interesting i i really hadn ' t think about it in many year how those black uh have integrate into the ci society i be tell i haven ' t see any of em but the black th they ' re not like our black they ' re no no small you know small feature but uh they be dark skinned and uh they look different and uh i don ' t know whether there be any other black jews over there but uh a lot from south africa but they ' re well educate people down there a lot of em a lot of jews from south afri oh yeah i ' m s i know that this fellow goldstone who be a head of this uh international war tri crimes tribunal be a jewish fellow because there be a picture of him in the paper with a yammaka on mm you have to look close pretty good indication pretty good indication well you know but uh these these what astound me be and this go back into nineteen let ' s
